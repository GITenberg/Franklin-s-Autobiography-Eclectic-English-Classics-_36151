<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>When Franklin was born, in 1706, Queen Anne was on the
English throne, and Swift and Defoe were pamphleteering. The
one had not yet written "Gulliver's Travels," nor the other "Robinson
Crusoe;" neither had Addison and Steele and other wits of
Anne's reign begun the "Spectator." Pope was eighteen years
old.</p>

<p>At that time ships bringing news, food and raiment, and laws
and governors to the ten colonies of America, ran grave chances
of falling into the hands of the pirates who infested the waters of
the shores. In Boston Cotton Mather was persecuting witches.
There were no stage coaches in the land,&mdash;merely a bridle path led
from New York to Philadelphia,&mdash;and a printing press throughout
the colonies was a raree-show.</p>

<p>Only six years before Franklin's birth, the first newspaper report
for the first newspaper in the country was written on the death
of Captain Kidd and six of his companions near Boston, when
the editor of the "News-Letter" told the story of the hanging of
the pirates, detailing the exhortations and prayers and their taking-off.
Franklin links us to another world of action.</p>

<p>His boyhood in Boston was a stern beginning of the habit of
hard work and rigid economy which marked the man. For a
year he went to the Latin Grammar School on School Street, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
left off at the age of ten to help his father in making soap and
candles. He persisted in showing such "bookish inclination,"
however, that at twelve his father apprenticed him to learn the
printer's trade. At seventeen he ran off to Philadelphia and there
began his independent career.</p>

<p>In the main he led such a life as the maxims of "Poor Richard"
    <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
enjoin. The pages of the Autobiography show few deviations
from such a course. He felt the need of school training and
set to work to educate himself. He had an untiring industry,
and love of the approval of his neighbor; and he knew that more
things fail through want of care than want of knowledge. His
practical imagination was continually forming projects; and, fortunately
for the world, his great physical strength and activity were
always setting his ideas in motion. He was human-hearted, and
this strong sympathy of his, along with his strength and zeal and
"projecting head" (as Defoe calls such a spirit), devised much
that helped life to amenity and comfort. In politics he had
the outlook of the self-reliant colonist whose devotion to the
mother institutions of England was finally alienated by the excesses
of a power which thought itself all-powerful.</p>

<p>In this Autobiography Franklin tells of his own life to the
year 1757, when he went to England to support the petition of
the legislature against Penn's sons. The grievance of the colonists
was a very considerable one, for the proprietaries claimed
that taxes should not be levied upon a tract greater than the
whole State of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Franklin was received in England with applause. His experiments
in electricity and his inventions had made him known, and
the sayings of "Poor Richard" were already in the mouths of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
people. But he waited nearly three years before he could obtain
a hearing for the matter for which he had crossed the sea.</p>

<p>During the delay he visited the ancient home of his family,
and made the acquaintance of men of mark, receiving also that
degree of Doctor of Civil Law by which he came to be known
as Dr. Franklin. In this time, too, he found how prejudiced was
the common English estimate of the value of the colonies. He
wrote Lord Kames in 1760, after the defeat of the French in
Canada: "No one can more sincerely rejoice than I do on the
reduction of Canada; and this is not merely as I am a colonist,
but as I am a Briton. I have long been of opinion that the <i>foundations
of the future grandeur and stability of the British empire lie
in America</i>; and though, like other foundations, they are low and
little now, they are, nevertheless, broad and strong enough to support
the greatest political structure that human wisdom ever yet
erected. I am, therefore, by no means for restoring Canada. If
we keep it all the country from the St. Lawrence to the Mississippi
will in another century be filled with British people. Britain
itself will become vastly more populous by the immense increase
of its commerce; the Atlantic sea will be covered with your trading
ships; and your naval power, thence continually increasing,
will extend your influence round the whole globe and awe the
world!... But I refrain, for I see you begin to think my
notions extravagant, and look upon them as the ravings of a
madman."</p>

<p>At last Franklin won the king's signature to a bill by the terms
of which the surveyed lands of the proprietaries should be assessed,
and, his business accomplished, he returned to Philadelphia.
"You require my history," he wrote to Lord Kames,
"from the time I yet sail for America. I left England about the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
end of August, 1762, in company with ten sail of merchant ships,
under a convoy of a man-of-war. We had a pleasant passage
to Madeira.... Here we furnished ourselves with fresh provisions,
and refreshments of all kinds; and, after a few days, proceeded
on our voyage, running southward until we got into the
trade winds, and then with them westward till we drew near the
coast of America. The weather was so favorable that there were
few days in which we could not visit from ship to ship, dining
with each other and on board of the man-of-war; which made
the time pass agreeably, much more so than when one goes in a
single ship; for this was like traveling in a moving village, with
all one's neighbors about one.</p>

<p>"On the 1st of November I arrived safe and well at my own
home, after an absence of near six years, found my wife and
daughter well,&mdash;the latter grown quite a woman, with many amiable
accomplishments acquired in my absence,&mdash;and my friends as
hearty and affectionate as ever, with whom my house was filled
for many days to congratulate me on my return. I had been
chosen yearly during my absence to represent the city of Philadelphia
in our Provincial Assembly; and on my appearance in
the House, they voted me three thousand pounds sterling for my
services in England, and their thanks, delivered by the Speaker.
In February following, my son arrived with my new daughter;
for, with my consent and approbation, he married, soon after I left
England, a very agreeable West India lady, with whom he is very
happy. I accompanied him to his government [New Jersey],
where he met with the kindest reception from the people of all
ranks, and has lived with them ever since in the greatest harmony.
A river only parts that province and ours, and his residence is
within seventeen miles of me, so that we frequently see each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
    "In the spring of 1763 I set out on a tour through all the northern
colonies to inspect and regulate the post offices in the several
provinces. In this journey I spent the summer, traveled about
sixteen hundred miles, and did not get home till the beginning of
November. The Assembly sitting through the following winter,
and warm disputes arising between them and the governor, I became
wholly engaged in public affairs; for, besides my duty as
an Assemblyman, I had another trust to execute, that of being
one of the commissioners appointed by law to dispose of the public
money appropriated to the raising and paying an army to act
against the Indians and defend the frontiers. And then, in December,
we had two insurrections of the back inhabitants of our
province.... Governor Penn made my house for some time
his headquarters, and did everything by my advice; so that for
about forty-eight hours I was a very great man, as I had been
once some years before, in a time of public danger.
    <a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"But the fighting face we put on and the reasoning we used
with the insurgents ... having turned them back and restored
quiet to the city, I became a less man than ever; for I had by
this transaction made myself many enemies among the populace;
and the governor, ... thinking it a favorable opportunity, joined
the whole weight of the proprietary interest to get me out of the
Assembly; which was accordingly effected at the last election by
a majority of about twenty-five in four thousand voters. The
House, however, when they met in October, approved of the resolutions
taken, while I was Speaker, of petitioning the Crown for
a change of government, and requested me to return to England
to prosecute that petition; which service I accordingly undertook,
and embarked at the beginning of November last, being accompanied
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
to the ship, sixteen miles, by a cavalcade of three hundred
of my friends, who filled our sails with their good wishes, and I
arrived in thirty days at London."</p>

<p>Instead of giving his efforts to the proposed change of government
Franklin found greater duties. The debt which England
had incurred during the war with the French in Canada she now
looked to the colonists for aid in removing. At home taxes were
levied by every device. The whole country was in distress and
laborers starving. In the colonies there was the thrift that comes
from narrowest means; but the people refused to answer parliamentary
levies and claimed that they would lay their own taxes
through their own legislatures. They resisted so successfully the
enforcement of the Stamp Act that Parliament began to discuss
its repeal. At this juncture Franklin was examined before the
Commons in regard to the results of the act.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Q.</i> Do you not think the people of America would submit to pay the stamp
duty if it was moderated?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, never, unless compelled by force of arms....</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What was the temper of America toward Great Britain before the year
1763?<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><i>A.</i> The best in the world. They submitted willingly to the government
of the Crown, and paid, in their courts, obedience to the acts of Parliament.
Numerous as the people are in the several old provinces, they cost you nothing
in forts, citadels, garrisons, or armies, to keep them in subjection. They
were governed by this country at the expense only of a little pen, ink, and
paper; they were led by a thread. They had not only a respect but an affection
for Great Britain, for its laws, its customs and manners, and even a
fondness for its fashions that greatly increased the commerce. Natives of
Britain were always treated with particular regard; to be an "Old England
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
man" was, of itself, a character of some respect, and gave a kind of rank
among us.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And what is their temper now?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, very much altered....</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> If the Stamp Act should be repealed, would it induce the assemblies
of America to acknowledge the right of Parliament to tax them, and would
they erase their resolutions?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, never.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Are there no means of obliging them to erase those resolutions?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> None that I know of; they will never do it unless compelled by force
of arms.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is there a power on earth that can force them to erase them?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No power, how great soever, can force men to change their opinions....</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What used to be the pride of the Americans?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To indulge in the fashions and manufactures of Great Britain.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is now their pride?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To wear their old clothes over again, till they can make new ones.</p>
</div>

<p>After the repeal of the act, Franklin wrote to his wife: "I am
willing you should have a new gown, which you may suppose I
did not send sooner as I knew you would not like to be finer than
your neighbors unless in a gown of your own spinning. Had the
trade between the two countries totally ceased, it was a comfort
to me to recollect that I had once been clothed from head to foot
in woolen and linen of my wife's manufacture, that I never was
prouder of any dress in my life, and that she and her daughter
might do it again if it was necessary."</p>

<p>Franklin stayed ten years in England. In 1774 he presented
to the king the petition of the first Continental Congress, in
which the petitioners, who protested their loyalty to Great Britain,
claimed the right of taxing themselves. But, finding this and
other efforts at adjustment of little avail, he returned to Philadelphia
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
in May, 1775. On the 5th of July he wrote to Mr. Strahan,
an old friend in London: "You are a member of Parliament,
and one of that majority which has doomed my country to destruction.
You have begun to burn our towns and murder our
people. Look upon your hands; they are stained with the blood
of your relations! You and I were long friends; you are now
my enemy, and I am yours."</p>

<p>After the Declaration of Independence and the establishment
of the States as a nation, Franklin was chosen as representative
to France. "I am old and good for nothing," he said, when
told of the choice, "but, as the storekeepers say of their remnants
of cloth, I am but a fag-end; you may have me for what
you please."</p>

<p>It was a most important post. France was the ancient enemy
of England, and the contingent of men and aid of money which
Franklin gained served to the successful issue of the Revolution.
He lived while in France at Passy, near Paris, from which he
wrote to a friend in England: "You are too early ... in calling
me rebel; you should wait for the event which will determine
whether it is a rebellion or only a revolution.... I know you
wish you could see me; but, as you cannot, I will describe myself
to you. Figure me in your mind as jolly as formerly, and as
strong and hearty, only a few years older; very plainly dressed,
wearing my thin, gray, straight hair, that peeps out under my only
coiffure, a fine fur cap which comes down my forehead almost to
my spectacles. Think how this must appear among the powdered
heads of Paris! I wish every lady and gentleman in France
would only be so obliging as to follow my fashion, comb their
own heads as I do mine, dismiss their friseurs, and pay me half
the money they pay to them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
    At last, in 1785, he came home, old and broken in health. He
was chosen president, or governor, of Pennsylvania, and the faith
of the people in his wisdom made him delegate to the convention
which framed the Constitution in 1787. He died in 1790,
and was buried by his wife in the graveyard of Christ Church,
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Dear Son:<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any
little anecdotes of my ancestors. You may remember the
inquiries I made among the remains of my relations when you
were with me in England, and the journey I undertook for that
purpose. Imagining it may be equally agreeable to you to know
the circumstances of my life, many of which you are yet unacquainted
with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week's uninterrupted
leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to
write them for you. To which I have besides some other inducements.
Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which
I was born and bred, to a state of affluence and some degree of
reputation in the world, and having gone so far through life with
a considerable share of felicity, the conducing means I made use
of, which with the blessing of God so well succeeded, my posterity
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
may like to know, as they may find some of them suitable to
their own situations, and therefore fit to be imitated.</p>

<p>That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes
to say that, were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection
to a repetition of the same life from its beginning, only asking
the advantages authors have in a second edition to correct
some faults of the first. So I might, besides correcting the faults,
change some sinister accidents and events of it for others more
favorable. But though this were denied, I should still accept the
offer. Since such a repetition is not to be expected, the next
thing like living one's life over again seems to be a recollection
of that life, and to make that recollection as durable as possible
by putting it down in writing.</p>

<p>Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination, so natural in old
men, to be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and
I shall indulge it without being tiresome to others,&mdash;who, through
respect to age, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a
hearing,&mdash;since this may be read or not as any one pleases. And,
lastly, (I may as well confess it, since my denial of it will be believed
by nobody,) perhaps I shall a good deal gratify my own
vanity. Indeed, I scarce ever heard or saw the introductory words,
"Without vanity, I may say," etc., but some vain thing immediately
followed. Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever
share they may have of it themselves; but I give it fair quarter
wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often productive
of good to the possessor, and to others that are within his
sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would not be
altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity
among the other comforts of life.</p>

<p>And now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility
to acknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past
life to his kind providence, which led me to the means I used and
gave them success. My belief of this induces me to hope, though
I must not presume, that the same goodness will still be exercised
toward me in continuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
a fatal reverse, which I may experience as others have done; the
complexion of my future fortune being known to Him only in
whose power it is to bless to us even our afflictions.</p>

<p>The notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity
in collecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands furnished
me with several particulars relating to our ancestors. From these
notes I learned that the family had lived in the same village,
Ecton, in Northamptonshire,<a name="FNanchor_N_1" id="FNanchor_N_1"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_1" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> for three hundred years, and how
much longer he knew not, (perhaps from the time when the name
of Franklin, that before was the name of an order of people,
    <a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was
assumed by them as a surname when others took surnames all
over the kingdom,) on a freehold of about thirty acres, aided by
the smith's business, which had continued in the family till his
time, the eldest son being always bred to that business,&mdash;a custom
which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons. When
I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an account of their
births, marriages, and burials from the year 1555 only, there being
no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding. By that
register I perceived that I was the youngest son of the youngest
son for five generations back. My grandfather, Thomas, who was
born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow business
longer, when he went to live with his son John, a dyer at
Banbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship.
There my grandfather died and lies buried. We saw
his gravestone in 1758. His eldest son, Thomas, lived in the house
at Ecton, and left it with the land to his only child, a daughter,
who, with her husband, one Fisher, of Wellingborough, sold it to
Mr. Isted, now lord of the manor there. My grandfather had
four sons that grew up, namely, Thomas, John, Benjamin, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Josiah. I will give you what account I can of them, at this distance
from my papers, and if these are not lost in my absence, you
will among them find many more particulars.</p>

<p>Thomas was bred a smith under his father; but, being ingenious,
and encouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an
Esquire<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
    Palmer, then the principal gentleman in that parish, he
qualified himself for the business of scrivener;<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> became a considerable
man in the county; was a chief mover of all public-spirited
undertakings for the county or town of Northampton and his own
village, of which many instances were related of him; and much
taken notice of and patronized by the then Lord Halifax. He
died in 1702, Jan. 6, old style,<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> just four years to a day before
I was born. The account we received of his life and character
from some old people at Ecton, I remember, struck you as something
extraordinary, from its similarity to what you knew of mine.
"Had he died on the same day," you said, "one might have
supposed a transmigration."<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>John was bred a dyer, I believe, of woolens. Benjamin was
bred a silk dyer, serving an apprenticeship at London. He was
an ingenious man. I remember him well, for when I was a boy
he came over to my father in Boston, and lived in the house with
us some years. He lived to a great age. His grandson, Samuel
Franklin, now lives in Boston. He left behind him two quarto volumes,
in manuscript, of his own poetry, consisting of little occasional
pieces addressed to his friends and relations, of which the following,
sent to me, is a specimen.<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He had formed a shorthand of
his own, which he taught me, but, never practicing it, I have now
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
forgot it. I was named after this uncle, there being a particular
affection between him and my father. He was very pious, a great
attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he took down
in his shorthand, and had with him many volumes of them. He
was also much of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station.
There fell lately into my hands, in London, a collection he had
made of all the principal pamphlets relating to public affairs, from
1641 to 1717; many of the volumes are wanting, as appears by
the numbering, but there still remain eight volumes in folio and
twenty-four in quarto and octavo. A dealer in old books met
with them, and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him, he
brought them to me. It seems my uncle must have left them
here when he went to America, which was above fifty years since.
There are many of his notes in the margins.</p>

<p>This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and
continued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary,
    <a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> when
they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal
against the queen's religion. They had got an English Bible, and
to conceal and secure it, it was fastened open with tapes under and
within the cover of a joint stool.<a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> When my great-great-grandfather
read it to his family, he turned up the joint stool upon his
knees, turning over the leaves then under the tapes. One of the
children stood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor
coming, who was an officer of the spiritual court. In that case
the stool was turned down again upon its feet, when the Bible remained
concealed under it as before. This anecdote I had from
my uncle Benjamin.</p>

<p>The family continued all of the Church of England till about
the end of Charles II.'s reign, when some of the ministers that
had been outed for <a name="noncon" id="noncon"></a>nonconformity,<a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> holding conventicles in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Northamptonshire, Benjamin and Josiah adhered to them, and so
continued all their lives; the rest of the family remained with the
Episcopal Church.</p>

<p>Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife, with
three children, into New England, about 1682. The conventicles
having been forbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced
some considerable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country,
and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither, where
they expected to enjoy their mode of religion with freedom. By
the same wife he had four children more born there, and by a
second wife ten more,&mdash;in all seventeen, of which I remember thirteen
sitting at one time at his table, who all grew up to be men
and women and married. I was the youngest son, and the youngest
child but two, and was born in Boston, New England.
    <a name="FNanchor_15_16" id="FNanchor_15_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> My
mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger, daughter of Peter
Folger, one of the first settlers of New England, of whom honorable
mention is made by Cotton Mather, in his Church history of
that country entitled "Magnalia Christi Americana," as "a goodly
learned Englishman," if I remember the words rightly. I have
heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces, but only one
of them was printed, which I saw now many years since. It was
written in 1675, in the homespun verse of that time and people,
and addressed to those then concerned in the government there.
It was in favor of liberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists,
Quakers, and other sectaries that had been under persecution,
    <a name="FNanchor_16_17" id="FNanchor_16_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
ascribing the Indian wars, and other distresses that had befallen
the country, to that persecution, as so many judgments of
God to punish so heinous an offense, and exhorting a repeal of
those uncharitable laws. The whole appeared to me as written
with a good deal of decent plainness and manly freedom. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
six concluding lines I remember, though I have forgotten the two
first of the stanza; but the purport of them was that his censures
proceeded from good will, and, therefore, he would be known to
be the author.</p>

<p>My elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades.
I was put to the grammar school<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> at eight years of age, my father
intending to devote me, as the tithe of his sons, to the service of
the church. My early readiness in learning to read, (which must
have been very early, as I do not remember when I could not
read,) and the opinion of all his friends that I should certainly
make a good scholar, encouraged him in this purpose of his. My
uncle Benjamin, too, approved of it, and proposed to give me all
his shorthand volumes of sermons, I suppose as a stock to set up
with, if I would learn his character.<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> I continued, however, at
the grammar school not quite one year, though in that time I had
risen gradually from the middle of the class of that year to be
the head of it, and, further, was removed into the next class above
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
it in order to go with that into the third at the end of the year.
But my father in the mean time, from a view of the expense of a
college education, which, having so large a family, he could not
well afford, and the mean living many so educated were afterward
able to obtain,&mdash;reasons that he gave to his friends in my
hearing,&mdash;altered his first intention, took me from the grammar
school, and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic, kept
by a then famous man, Mr. George Brownell, very successful in
his profession generally, and that by mild, encouraging methods.
Under him I acquired fair writing pretty soon, but I failed in the
arithmetic, and made no progress in it. At ten years old I was
taken home to assist my father in his business, which was that of
a tallow chandler and soap boiler, a business he was not bred to,
but had assumed on his arrival in New England, and on finding
his dyeing trade would not maintain his family, being in little request.
Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wick for the
candles, filling the dipping mold and the molds for cast candles,
    <a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
attending the shop, going of errands, etc.</p>

<p>I disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea,
but my father declared against it. However, living near the water,
I was much in and about it, learned early to swim well and to
manage boats; and when in a boat or canoe with other boys I
was commonly allowed to govern, especially in any case of difficulty;
and upon other occasions I was generally a leader among
the boys, and sometimes led them into scrapes, of which I will
mention one instance, as it shows an early projecting public
spirit, though not then justly conducted.</p>

<p>There was a salt marsh that bounded part of the mill pond, on
the edge of which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for
minnows. By much trampling we had made it a mere quagmire.
My proposal was to build a wharf there fit for us to stand upon,
and I showed my comrades a large heap of stones which were intended
for a new house near the marsh and which would very well
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
suit our purpose. Accordingly, in the evening, when the workmen
were gone, I assembled a number of my playfellows, and
working with them diligently like so many emmets,<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> sometimes
two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and built our
little wharf. The next morning the workmen were surprised at
missing the stones, which were found in our wharf. Inquiry was
made after the removers; we were discovered and complained
of; several of us were corrected by our fathers; and, though I
pleaded the usefulness of the work, mine convinced me that
nothing was useful which was not honest.</p>

<p>I think you may like to know something of his person and character.
He had an excellent constitution of body, was of middle
stature, but well set and very strong. He was ingenious, could
draw prettily, was skilled a little in music, and had a clear, pleasing
voice, so that when he played psalm tunes on his violin and
sung withal, as he sometimes did in an evening after the business
of the day was over, it was extremely agreeable to hear. He had
a mechanical genius, too, and on occasion was very handy in the
use of other tradesmen's tools; but his great excellence lay in a
sound understanding and solid judgment in prudential matters,
both in private and public affairs. In the latter, indeed, he was
never employed, the numerous family he had to educate and the
straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to his trade; but
I remember well his being frequently visited by leading people,
who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of the
church he belonged to, and showed a good deal of respect for his
judgment and advice; he was also much consulted by private
persons about their affairs when any difficulty occurred, and frequently
chosen an arbitrator between contending parties. At his
table he liked to have as often as he could some sensible friend
or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to start some
ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve
the minds of his children. By this means he turned our
attention to what was good, just, and prudent in the conduct of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
life, and little or no notice was ever taken of what related to the
victuals on the table, whether it was well or ill dressed, in or out
of season, of good or bad flavor, preferable or inferior to this or
that other thing of the kind, so that I was brought up in such a
perfect inattention to those matters as to be quite indifferent what
kind of food was set before me, and so unobservant of it that to
this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a few hours after dinner
what I dined upon. This has been a convenience to me in traveling,
where my companions have been sometimes very unhappy
for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate, because
better instructed, tastes and appetites.</p>

<p>My mother had likewise an excellent constitution. I never
knew either my father or mother to have any sickness but that
of which they died, he at eighty-nine and she at eighty-five years
of age. They lie buried together at Boston, where I some years
since placed a marble<a name="FNanchor_23_24" id="FNanchor_23_24"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> over their grave with this inscription:</p>

<p>By my rambling digressions I perceive myself to be grown old.
I used to write more methodically. But one does not dress for
private company as for a public ball. 'Tis perhaps only negligence.</p>

<p>To return: I continued thus employed in my father's business
for two years, that is, till I was twelve years old; and my brother
John, who was bred to that business, having left my father, married,
and set up for himself at Rhode Island, there was all appearance
that I was destined to supply his place and become a tallow
chandler. But my dislike to the trade continuing, my father
was under apprehensions that if he did not find one for me more
agreeable I should break away and get to sea, as his son Josiah
had done, to his great vexation. He therefore sometimes took me
to walk with him, and see joiners, bricklayers, turners, brasiers,
    <a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
etc., at their work, that he might observe my inclination and endeavor
to fix it on some trade or other on land. It has ever since
been a pleasure to me to see good workmen handle their tools;
and it has been useful to me, having learned so much by it as to
be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a workman could
not readily be got, and to construct little machines for my experiments
while the intention of making the experiment was fresh
and warm in my mind. My father at last fixed upon the cutler's
trade, and my uncle Benjamin's son, Samuel, who was bred to that
business in London, being about that time established in Boston,
I was sent to be with him some time on liking. But his expectations
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of a fee with me displeasing my father, I was taken home
again.</p>

<p>From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money
that came into my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased
with the "Pilgrim's Progress," my first collection was of John
Bunyan's works in separate little volumes. I afterward sold them
to enable me to buy R. Burton's "Historical Collections;" they
were small chapmen's<a name="FNanchor_26_27" id="FNanchor_26_27"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> books, and cheap, forty or fifty in all. My
father's little library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity,
most of which I read, and have since often regretted that, at
a time when I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books
had not fallen in my way, since it was now resolved I should not
be a clergyman. "Plutarch's Lives" there was, in which I read
abundantly, and I still think that time spent to great advantage.
There was also a book of Defoe's called an "Essay on Projects,"
and another of Dr. Mather's called "Essays to Do Good," which
perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on some
of the principal future events of my life.</p>

<p>This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make
me a printer, though he had already one son (James) of that profession.
In 1717 my brother James returned from England with
a press and letters to set up his business in Boston. I liked it
much better than that of my father, but still had a hankering for
the sea. To prevent the apprehended effect of such an inclination,
my father was impatient to have me bound to my brother.
I stood out some time, but at last was persuaded and signed the
indentures<a name="FNanchor_27_28" id="FNanchor_27_28"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> when I was yet but twelve years old. I was to serve
as an apprentice till I was twenty-one years of age, only I was to
be allowed journeyman's wages during the last year. In a little
time I made great proficiency in the business, and became a useful
hand to my brother. I now had access to better books. An
acquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
to borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon
and clean. Often I sat up in my room reading the greatest part
of the night, when the book was borrowed in the evening and to
be returned early in the morning, lest it should be missed or wanted.</p>

<p>And after some time an ingenious tradesman, Mr. Matthew
Adams, who had a pretty collection of books, and who frequented
our printing house, took notice of me, invited me to his library,
and very kindly lent me such books as I chose to read. I now
took a fancy to poetry, and made some little pieces; my brother,
thinking it might turn to account, encouraged me, and put me
on composing occasional ballads. One was called "The Lighthouse
Tragedy," and contained an account of the drowning of
Captain Worthilake with his two daughters; the other was a sailor's
song on the taking of Teach (or Blackbeard), the pirate. They
were wretched stuff, in the Grub Street<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> ballad style; and when
they were printed he sent me about the town to sell them. The
first sold wonderfully, the event being recent, having made a great
noise. This flattered my vanity; but my father discouraged me
by ridiculing my performances and telling me verse makers were
generally beggars. So I escaped being a poet, most probably a
very bad one; but as prose writing has been of great use to me in
the course of my life, and was a principal means of my advancement,
I shall tell you how, in such a situation, I acquired what
little ability I have in that way.</p>

<p>There was another bookish lad in the town, John Collins by
name, with whom I was intimately acquainted. We sometimes
disputed, and very fond we were of argument and very desirous
of confuting each other; which disputatious turn, by the way, is
apt to become a very bad habit,<a name="FNanchor_N_2" id="FNanchor_N_2"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_2" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> making people often extremely
disagreeable in company by the contradiction that is necessary to
bring it into practice; and thence, besides souring and spoiling
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the conversation, is productive of disgusts and perhaps enmities
where you may have occasion for friendship. I had caught it
by reading my father's books of dispute about religion. Persons
of good sense, I have since observed, seldom fall into it, except
lawyers, university men, and men of all sorts that have been bred
at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>A question was once, somehow or other, started between Collins
and me, of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning,
and their abilities for study. He was of opinion that it was
improper, and that they were naturally unequal to it. I took the
contrary side, perhaps a little for dispute's sake. He was naturally
more eloquent, had a ready plenty of words, and sometimes,
as I thought, bore me down more by his fluency than by the
strength of his reasons. As we parted without settling the point,
and were not to see each other again for some time, I sat down
to put my arguments in writing, which I copied fair and sent to
him. He answered, and I replied. Three or four letters of a
side had passed, when my father happened to find my papers and
read them. Without entering into the discussion, he took occasion
to talk to me about the manner of my writing. He observed
that, though I had the advantage of my antagonist in correct
spelling and pointing (which I owed to the printing house), I fell
far short in elegance of expression, in method, and in perspicuity,
of which he convinced me by several instances. I saw the justice
of his remarks, and thence grew more attentive to the manner
in writing, and determined to endeavor at improvement.</p>

<p>About this time I met with an odd volume of the "Spectator."
    <a name="FNanchor_29_30" id="FNanchor_29_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
It was the third. I had never before seen any of them. I bought
it, read it over and over, and was much delighted with it. I
thought the writing excellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it.
With this view, I took some of the papers, and, making short hints
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and
then, without looking at the book, tried to complete the papers
again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully
as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should
come to hand. Then I compared my "Spectator" with the original,
discovered some of my faults, and corrected them. But I
found I wanted a stock of words, or a readiness in recollecting
and using them, which I thought I should have acquired before
that time if I had gone on making verses; since the continual
occasion for words of the same import, but of different length to
suit the measure, or of different sound for the rhyme, would have
laid me under a constant necessity of searching for variety, and
also have tended to fix that variety in my mind and make me master
of it. Therefore I took some of the tales and turned them
into verse; and, after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten
the prose, turned them back again. I also sometimes jumbled
my collections of hints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored
to reduce them into the best order before I began to
form the full sentences and complete the paper. This was to teach
me method in the arrangement of thoughts. By comparing my
work afterward with the original, I discovered many faults and
amended them; but I sometimes had the pleasure of fancying
that in certain particulars of small import I had been lucky
enough to improve the method or the language, and this encouraged
me to think I might possibly in time come to be a tolerable
English writer, of which I was extremely ambitious. My time
for these exercises and for reading was at night after work, or
before it began in the morning, or on Sundays, when I contrived
to be in the printing house alone, evading as much as I could the
common attendance on public worship, which my father used to
exact of me when I was under his care, and which indeed I still
thought a duty, though I could not, as it seemed to me, afford
time to practice it.</p>

<p>When about sixteen years of age I happened to meet with a
book, written by one Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet. I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
determined to go into it. My brother, being yet unmarried, did
not keep house, but boarded himself and his apprentices in another
family. My refusal to eat flesh occasioned an inconveniency, and
I was frequently chid for my singularity. I made myself acquainted
with Tryon's manner of preparing some of his dishes,
such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hasty pudding, and a few
others, and then proposed to my brother that if he would give
me weekly half the money he paid for my board I would board
myself. He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I
could save half what he paid me. This was an additional fund
for buying books. But I had another advantage in it. My
brother and the rest going from the printing house to their meals,
I remained there alone, and, dispatching presently my light repast,
which often was no more than a biscuit or a slice of bread,
a handful of raisins, or a tart from the pastry cook's, and a glass
of water, had the rest of the time till their return for study, in
which I made the greater progress from that greater clearness of
head and quicker apprehension which usually attend temperance
in eating and drinking.</p>

<p>And now it was that, being on some occasion made ashamed
of my ignorance in figures, which I had twice failed in learning
when at school, I took Cocker's book of arithmetic, and went
through the whole by myself with great ease. I also read Seller's
and Shermy's books of navigation, and became acquainted with
the little geometry they contain, but never proceeded far in that
science. And I read about this time Locke "On the Human
Understanding," and the "Art of Thinking," by Messrs. du Port
Royal.<a name="FNanchor_30_31" id="FNanchor_30_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_31" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>While I was intent on improving my language, I met with an
English grammar (I think it was Greenwood's), at the end of which
there were two little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic,
the latter finishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
method;<a name="FNanchor_31_32" id="FNanchor_31_32"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_31_32" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and soon after I procured Xenophon's "Memorable
Things of Socrates," wherein there are many instances of the same
method. I was charmed with it, adopted it, dropped my abrupt
contradiction and positive argumentation, and put on the humble
inquirer and doubter. And being then, from reading Shaftesbury
and Collins, become a real doubter in many points of our religious
doctrine, I found this method safest for myself and very
embarrassing to those against whom I used it. Therefore I took
a delight in it, practiced it continually, and grew very artful and
expert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge, into concessions
the consequences of which they did not foresee, entangling
them in difficulties out of which they could not extricate
themselves, and so obtaining victories that neither myself nor my
cause always deserved.</p>

<p>I continued this method some few years, but gradually left it,
retaining only the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest
diffidence; never using, when I advanced anything that may possibly
be disputed, the words "certainly," "undoubtedly," or any
others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather
saying, "I conceive" or "apprehend" a thing to be so and so;
"it appears to me," or "I should think it so or so," for such and
such reasons; or "I imagine it to be so;" or "it is so, if I am
not mistaken." This habit, I believe, has been of great advantage
to me when I have had occasion to inculcate my opinions, and
persuade men into measures that I have been from time to time
engaged in promoting; and, as the chief ends of conversation are
to inform or to be informed, to please or to persuade, I wish well-meaning,
sensible men would not lessen their power of doing good
by a positive, assuming manner, that seldom fails to disgust, tends
to create opposition, and to defeat every one of those purposes for
which speech was given to us,&mdash;to wit, giving or receiving information
or pleasure. For if you would inform, a positive and dogmatical
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
manner in advancing your sentiments may provoke contradiction
and prevent a candid attention. If you wish information
and improvement from the knowledge of others, and yet at the
same time express yourself as firmly fixed in your present opinions,
modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation, will probably
leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error. And by
such a manner you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in
pleasing your hearers, or to persuade those whose concurrence you
desire. Pope says judiciously:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Men must be taught as if you taught them not,<br /></span>
<span class="i00">And things unknown propos'd as things forgot;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>further recommending to us to</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And he might have coupled with this line that which he has
coupled with another, I think, less properly:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For want of modesty is want of sense."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If you ask why less properly, I must repeat the lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Immodest words admit of no defense,<br /></span>
<span class="i00">For want of modesty is want of sense."
    <a name="FNanchor_32_33" id="FNanchor_32_33"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_32_33" class="fnanchor">[32]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, is not "want of sense" (where a man is so unfortunate as
to want it) some apology for his "want of modesty?" and would
not the lines stand more justly thus?</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Immodest words admit <i>but</i> this defense,<br /></span>
<span class="i00">That want of modesty is want of sense."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This, however, I should submit to better judgments.<a name="FNanchor_N_3" id="FNanchor_N_3"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_3" class="fnanchor">[n]</a></p>

<p>My brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper.
It was the second that appeared in America, and was called the
"New England Courant."<a name="FNanchor_33_34" id="FNanchor_33_34"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_33_34" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The only one
    before it was the "Boston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
News-Letter." I remember his being dissuaded by some of
his friends from the undertaking, as not likely to succeed, one
newspaper being, in their judgment, enough for America. At
this time (1771) there are not less than five and twenty. He went
on, however, with the undertaking, and after having worked in
composing the types and printing off the sheets, I was employed
to carry the papers through the streets to the customers.</p>

<p>He had some ingenious men among his friends, who amused
themselves by writing little pieces for this paper, which gained it
credit and made it more in demand; and these gentlemen often
visited us. Hearing their conversations and their accounts of
the approbation their papers were received with, I was excited to
try my hand among them; but, being still a boy, and suspecting
that my brother would object to printing anything of mine in his
paper if he knew it to be mine, I contrived to disguise my hand,
and, writing an anonymous paper, I put it in at night under the
door of the printing house. It was found in the morning, and
communicated to his writing friends when they called in as usual.
They read it, commented on it in my hearing, and I had the exquisite
pleasure of finding it met with their approbation, and that,
in their different guesses at the author, none were named but men
of some character among us for learning and ingenuity. I suppose
now that I was rather lucky in my judges, and that perhaps
they were not really so very good ones as I then esteemed
them.</p>

<p>Encouraged, however, by this, I wrote and conveyed in the
same way to the press several more papers, which were equally
approved; and I kept my secret till my small fund of sense for
such performances was pretty well exhausted, and then I discovered
    <a name="FNanchor_34_35" id="FNanchor_34_35"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_34_35" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
it, when I began to be considered a little more by my
brother's acquaintance, and in a manner that did not quite please
him, as he thought, probably with reason, that it tended to make
me too vain. And perhaps this might be one occasion of the
differences that we began to have about this time. Though a
brother, he considered himself as my master and me as his apprentice,
and accordingly expected the same services from me as
he would from another, while I thought he demeaned<a name="FNanchor_35_36" id="FNanchor_35_36"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_35_36" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> me too
much in some he required of me, who from a brother expected
more indulgence. Our disputes were often brought before our
father, and I fancy I was either generally in the right or else a
better pleader, because the judgment was generally in my favor.
But my brother was passionate, and had often beaten me, which
I took extremely amiss; and, thinking my apprenticeship very
tedious, I was continually wishing for some opportunity of shortening
it, which at length offered in a manner unexpected.</p>

<p>One of the pieces in our newspaper, on some political point
which I have now forgotten, gave offense to the Assembly.
    <a name="FNanchor_36_37" id="FNanchor_36_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_37" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> He
was taken up, censured, and imprisoned for a month, by the
Speaker's warrant, I suppose, because he would not discover his
author. I, too, was taken up and examined before the council;
but, though I did not give them any satisfaction, they contented
themselves with admonishing me, and dismissed me, considering
me, perhaps, as an apprentice, who was bound to keep his master's
secrets.</p>

<p>During my brother's confinement, which I resented a good deal,
notwithstanding our private differences, I had the management of
the paper; and I made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it,
which my brother took very kindly, while others began to consider
me in an unfavorable light, as a young genius that had a
turn for libeling and satire. My brother's discharge was accompanied
with an order of the House (a very odd one) that James
Franklin should no longer print the paper called the "New England
Courant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
    There was a consultation held in our printing house among his
friends what he should do in this case. Some proposed to evade
the order by changing the name of the paper; but my brother
seeing inconveniences in that, it was finally concluded on, as a
better way, to let it be printed for the future under the name of
Benjamin Franklin; and to avoid the censure of the Assembly
that might fall on him as still printing it by his apprentice, the
contrivance was that my old indenture should be returned to me,
with a full discharge on the back of it, to be shown on occasion;
but to secure to him the benefit of my service I was to sign new
indentures for the remainder of the term, which were to be kept
private. A very flimsy scheme it was; however, it was immediately
executed, and the paper went on accordingly under my
name for several months.</p>

<p>At length, a fresh difference arising between my brother and me,
I took upon me to assert my freedom, presuming that he would
not venture to produce the new indentures. It was not fair in
me to take this advantage, and this I therefore reckon one of the
first errata<a name="FNanchor_37_38" id="FNanchor_37_38"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_37_38" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> of my life; but
    the unfairness of it weighed little with
me when under the impressions of resentment for the blows his
passion too often urged him to bestow upon me, though he was
otherwise not an ill-natured man. Perhaps I was too saucy and
provoking.</p>

<p>When he found I would leave him, he took care to prevent
my getting employment in any other printing house of the town,
by going round and speaking to every master, who accordingly
refused to give me work. I then thought of going to New York,
as the nearest place where there was a printer; and I was rather
inclined to leave Boston when I reflected that I had already
made myself a little obnoxious to the governing party, and, from
the arbitrary proceedings of the Assembly in my brother's case,
it was likely I might, if I stayed, soon bring myself into scrapes;
and, further, that my indiscreet disputations about religion began
to make me pointed at with horror by good people as an infidel
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
or atheist. I determined on the point, but, my father now siding
with my brother, I was sensible that, if I attempted to go openly,
means would be used to prevent me. My friend Collins, therefore,
undertook to manage a little for me. He agreed with the
captain of a New York sloop for my passage, under the notion of
my being a young acquaintance of his that had got into trouble,
and therefore I could not appear or come away publicly. So I
sold some of my books to raise a little money, was taken on board
privately, and, as we had a fair wind, in three days I found myself
in New York, near three hundred miles from home, a boy
of but seventeen, without the least recommendation to, or knowledge
of, any person in the place, and with very little money in
my pocket.</p>

<h2>§ 2. SEEKS HIS FORTUNE.</h2>

<p>My inclinations for the sea were by this time worn out, or I
might now have gratified them. But, having a trade, and
supposing myself a pretty good workman, I offered my service to
the printer in the place, old Mr. William Bradford, who had been
the first printer in Pennsylvania, but removed from thence upon
the quarrel of George Keith. He could give me no employment,
having little to do and help enough already; but says he, "My
son at Philadelphia has lately lost his principal hand, Aquila
Rose, by death; if you go thither I believe he may employ you."
Philadelphia was a hundred miles farther; I set out, however, in
a boat for Amboy, leaving my chest and things to follow me
round by sea.</p>

<p>In crossing the bay we met with a squall that tore our rotten
sails to pieces, prevented our getting into the Kill,<a name="FNanchor_38_39" id="FNanchor_38_39"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_38_39" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and drove us
upon Long Island. In our way, a drunken Dutchman, who was
a passenger too, fell overboard. When he was sinking, I reached
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
through the water to his shock pate, and drew him up so that we
got him in again. His ducking sobered him a little, and he went
to sleep, taking first out of his pocket a book, which he desired
I would dry for him. It proved to be my old favorite author,
Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress," in Dutch, finely printed on good
paper, with copper cuts, a dress better than I had ever seen it
wear in its own language. I have since found that it has been
translated into most of the languages of Europe, and suppose it
has been more generally read than any other book, except, perhaps,
the Bible. Honest John<a name="FNanchor_39_40" id="FNanchor_39_40"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_39_40" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> was the first that I know of who
mixed narration and dialogue; a method of writing very engaging
to the reader, who in the most interesting parts finds himself, as
it were, brought into the company and present at the discourse.
Defoe<a name="FNanchor_N_5" id="FNanchor_N_5"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_5" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> in his
    "Crusoe," his "Moll Flanders," "Religious Courtship,"
"Family Instructor," and other pieces, has imitated it with
success; and Richardson has done the same in his "Pamela," etc.</p>

<p>When we drew near the island we found it was at a place where
there could be no landing, there being a great surf on the stony
beach. So we dropped anchor, and swung round toward the
shore. Some people came down to the water edge and hallooed
to us, as we did to them; but the wind was so high and the surf
so loud that we could not hear so as to understand each other.
There were canoes on the shore, and we made signs, and hallooed
that they should fetch us; but they either did not understand us
or thought it impracticable, so they went away, and night coming
on, we had no remedy but to wait till the wind should abate.
In the mean time, the boatman and I concluded to sleep if we
could, and so crowded into the scuttle with the Dutchman, who
was still wet, and the spray beating over the head of our boat
leaked through to us, so that we were soon almost as wet as he.
In this manner we lay all night, with very little rest; but the wind
abating the next day, we made a shift to reach Amboy before
night, having been thirty hours on the water, without victuals, or any
drink but a bottle of filthy rum, the water we sailed on being salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
    In the evening I found myself very feverish, and went in to
bed; but, having read somewhere that cold water, drunk plentifully,
was good for a fever, I followed the prescription, sweat
plentifully most of the night, my fever left me, and in the morning,
crossing the ferry, I proceeded on my journey on foot, having
fifty miles to Burlington,<a name="FNanchor_40_41" id="FNanchor_40_41"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_40_41" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> where I was told I should find boats
that would carry me the rest of the way to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It rained very hard all the day. I was thoroughly soaked, and
by noon a good deal tired, so I stopped at a poor inn, where I
stayed all night, beginning now to wish that I had never left home.
I cut so miserable a figure, too, that I found, by the questions
asked me, I was suspected to be some runaway servant and in
danger of being taken up on that suspicion. However, I proceeded
the next day, and got in the evening to an inn, within
eight or ten miles of Burlington, kept by one Dr. Brown. He
entered into conversation with me while I took some refreshment,
and, finding I had read a little, became very sociable and friendly.
Our acquaintance continued as long as he lived.<a name="FNanchor_N_6" id="FNanchor_N_6"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_6" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> He had been,
I imagine, an itinerant doctor; for there was no town in England,
or country in Europe, of which he could not give a very particular
account. He had some letters,<a name="FNanchor_41_42" id="FNanchor_41_42"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_41_42" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and was ingenious, but much
of an unbeliever, and wickedly undertook, some years after, to
travesty the Bible in doggerel verse, as Cotton had done Virgil.
By this means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light,
and might have hurt weak minds if his work had been published;
but it never was.</p>

<p>At his house I lay that night, and the next morning reached
Burlington, but had the mortification to find that the regular boats
were gone a little before my coming, and no other expected to
go before Tuesday, this being Saturday; wherefore I returned to
an old woman in the town of whom I had bought gingerbread to
eat on the water, and asked her advice. She invited me to lodge
at her house till a passage by water should offer; and, being tired
with my foot traveling, I accepted the invitation. She, understanding
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
I was a printer, would have had me stay at that town
and follow my business, being ignorant of the stock necessary to
begin with. She was very hospitable, gave me a dinner of ox
cheek with great good will, accepting only of a pot of ale in return;
and I thought myself fixed till Tuesday should come.
However, walking in the evening by the side of the river, a boat
came by, which I found was going toward Philadelphia, with several
people in her. They took me in, and, as there was no wind, we
rowed all the way, and about midnight, not having yet seen the
city, some of the company were confident we must have passed
it, and would row no farther. The others knew not where we
were; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek, and landed
near an old fence, with the rails of which we made a fire, the
night being cold, in October, and there we remained till daylight.
Then one of the company knew the place to be Cooper's Creek,
a little above Philadelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out
of the creek, and arrived there about eight or nine o'clock on the
Sunday morning, and landed at the Market Street wharf.</p>

<p>I have been the more particular in this description of my journey,
and shall be so of my first entry into that city, that you may
in your mind compare such unlikely beginnings with the figure
I have since made there. I was in my working dress, my best
clothes being to come round by sea. I was dirty from my journey;
my pockets were stuffed out with shirts and stockings, and
I knew no soul, nor where to look for lodging. I was fatigued
with traveling, rowing, and want of rest; I was very hungry; and
my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch dollar and about a
shilling in copper.<a name="FNanchor_42_43" id="FNanchor_42_43"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_42_43" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The latter I gave the people of the boat for
my passage, who at first refused it, on account of my rowing; but
I insisted on their taking it, a man being sometimes more generous
when he has but a little money than when he has plenty,
perhaps through fear of being thought to have but little.</p>

<p>Then I walked up the street, gazing about, till near the market
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
house I met a boy with bread. I had made many a meal on
bread, and, inquiring where he got it, I went immediately to the
baker's he directed me to, in Second Street, and asked for biscuit,
intending such as we had in Boston; but they, it seems, were
not made in Philadelphia. Then I asked for a threepenny loaf,
and was told they had none such. So not considering or knowing
the difference of money and the greater cheapness, nor the
names of his bread, I bade him give me threepenny worth of any
sort. He gave me, accordingly, three great puffy rolls. I was
surprised at the quantity, but took it, and, having no room in my
pockets, walked off with a roll under each arm, and eating the
other. Thus I went up Market Street as far as Fourth Street,
passing by the door of Mr. Read, my future wife's father; when
she, standing at the door, saw me, and thought I made, as I certainly
did, a most awkward, ridiculous appearance. Then I turned
and went down Chestnut Street and part of Walnut Street, eating
my roll all the way, and, coming round, found myself again
at Market Street wharf, near the boat I came in, to which I went
for a draught of the river water; and, being filled with one of my
rolls, gave the other two to a woman and her child that came
down the river in the boat with us, and were waiting to go farther.</p>

<p>Thus refreshed, I walked again up the street, which by this
time had many clean-dressed people in it, who were all walking
the same way. I joined them, and thereby was led into the great
meetinghouse of the Quakers near the market.<a name="FNanchor_43_44" id="FNanchor_43_44"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_43_44" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> I sat down
among them, and, after looking round awhile and hearing nothing
said, being very drowsy through labor and want of rest the
preceding night, I fell fast asleep, and continued so till the meeting
broke up, when one was kind enough to rouse me. This was,
therefore, the first house I was in, or slept in, in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Walking down again toward the river, and looking in the faces
of people, I met a young Quaker man, whose countenance I liked,
and, accosting him, requested he would tell me where a stranger
could get lodging. We were then near the sign of the Three
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Mariners. "Here," says he, "is one place that entertains strangers,
but it is not a reputable house; if thee wilt walk with me I'll
show thee a better." He brought me to the Crooked Billet, in
Water Street. Here I got a dinner, and while I was eating it
several sly questions were asked me, as it seemed to be suspected
from my youth and appearance that I might be some runaway.</p>

<p>After dinner my sleepiness returned; and, being shown to a
bed, I lay down without undressing and slept till six in the evening,
was called to supper, went to bed again very early, and slept
soundly till next morning. Then I made myself as tidy as I
could, and went to Andrew Bradford the printer's. I found in
the shop the old man, his father, whom I had seen at New York,
and who, traveling on horseback, had got to Philadelphia before
me. He introduced me to his son, who received me civilly, and
gave me a breakfast, but told me he did not at present want a
hand, being lately supplied with one; but there was another printer
in town, lately set up, one Keimer, who, perhaps, might employ
me; if not, I should be welcome to lodge at his house, and he
would give me a little work to do now and then till fuller business
should offer.</p>

<p>The old gentleman said he would go with me to the new
printer; and when we found him, "Neighbor," says Bradford, "I
have brought to see you a young man of your business; perhaps
you may want such a one." He asked me a few questions, put
a composing stick<a name="FNanchor_44_45" id="FNanchor_44_45"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_44_45" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> in my hand to see how I worked, and then
said he would employ me soon, though he had just then nothing
for me to do; and, taking old Bradford, whom he had never seen
before, to be one of the townspeople that had a good will for him,
he entered into a conversation on his present undertaking and
prospects; while Bradford, not discovering that he was the other
printer's father, on Keimer's saying he expected soon to get the
greatest part of the business into his own hands, drew him on by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
artful questions, and starting little doubts, to explain all his views,
what interest he relied on, and in what manner he intended to proceed.
I, who stood by and heard all, saw immediately that one
of them was a crafty old sophister,<a name="FNanchor_45_46" id="FNanchor_45_46"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_45_46" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and the other a mere novice.
Bradford left me with Keimer, who was greatly surprised when I
told him who the old man was.</p>

<p>Keimer's printing house, I found, consisted of an old shattered
press and one small, worn-out font of English,<a name="FNanchor_46_47" id="FNanchor_46_47"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_46_47" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> which he was
then using himself, composing an elegy on Aquila Rose, before
mentioned, an ingenious young man of excellent character, much
respected in the town, clerk of the Assembly, and a pretty poet.
Keimer made verses too, but very indifferently. He could not
be said to write them, for his manner was to compose them in the
types, directly out of his head. So, there being no copy,
    <a name="FNanchor_47_48" id="FNanchor_47_48"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_47_48" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> but one
pair of cases, and the elegy likely to require all the letters, no one
could help him. I endeavored to put his press (which he had not
yet used and of which he understood nothing) into order fit to
be worked with; and, promising to come and print off his elegy
as soon as he should have got it ready, I returned to Bradford's,
who gave me a little job to do for the present, and there I lodged
and dieted.<a name="FNanchor_48_49" id="FNanchor_48_49"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_48_49" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> A few days after Keimer sent for me to print off
the elegy. And now he had got another pair of cases, and a
pamphlet to reprint, on which he set me to work.</p>

<p>These two printers I found poorly qualified for their business.
Bradford had not been bred to it, and was very illiterate; and
Keimer, though something of a scholar, was a mere compositor,
knowing nothing of press work. He had been one of the French
prophets,<a name="FNanchor_49_50" id="FNanchor_49_50"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_49_50" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and could
    act their enthusiastic agitations. At this
time he did not profess any particular religion, but something of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
all on occasion, was very ignorant of the world, and had, as I
afterward found, a good deal of the knave in his composition.
He did not like my lodging at Bradford's while I worked with
him. He had a house, indeed, but without furniture, so he could
not lodge me; but he got me a lodging at Mr. Read's, before
mentioned, who was the owner of his house; and, my chest and
clothes being come by this time, I made rather a more respectable
appearance in the eyes of Miss Read than I had done when
she first happened to see me eating my roll in the street.</p>

<p>I began now to have some acquaintance among the young people
of the town that were lovers of reading, with whom I spent
my evenings very pleasantly; and, gaining money by my industry
and frugality, I lived very agreeably, forgetting Boston as much
as I could, and not desiring that any there should know where I
resided, except my friend Collins, who was in my secret and kept
it when I wrote to him. At length an incident happened that
sent me back again much sooner than I had intended. I had a
brother-in-law, Robert Holmes, master of a sloop that traded between
Boston and Delaware. He being at Newcastle, forty miles
below Philadelphia, heard there of me, and wrote me a letter, mentioning
the concern of my friends in Boston at my abrupt departure,
assuring me of their good will to me and that everything
would be accommodated to my mind if I would return, to which
he exhorted me very earnestly. I wrote an answer to his letter,
thanked him for his advice, but stated my reasons for quitting
Boston fully and in such a light as to convince him I was not so
wrong as he had apprehended.</p>

<p>Sir William Keith, governor of the province, was then at Newcastle;
and Captain Holmes, happening to be in company with
him when my letter came to hand, spoke to him of me and showed
him the letter. The governor read it, and seemed surprised when
he was told my age. He said I appeared a young man of promising
parts, and therefore should be encouraged; the printers at
Philadelphia were wretched ones; and, if I would set up there,
he made no doubt I should succeed; for his part, he would procure
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
me the public business, and do me every other service in his
power. This my brother-in-law afterward told me in Boston,
but I knew as yet nothing of it when, one day, Keimer and I
being at work together near the window, we saw the governor
and another gentleman (which proved to be Colonel French of
Newcastle), finely dressed, come directly across the street to our
house, and heard them at the door.</p>

<p>Keimer ran down immediately, thinking it a visit to him; but
the governor inquired for me, came up, and with a condescension
and politeness I had been quite unused to, made me many compliments,
desired to be acquainted with me, blamed me kindly for
not having made myself known to him when I first came to the
place, and would have me away with him to the tavern, where he
was going with Colonel French to taste, as he said, some excellent
Madeira. I was not a little surprised, and Keimer stared like a
pig poisoned. I went, however, with the governor and Colonel
French to a tavern at the corner of Third Street, and over the
Madeira he proposed my setting up my business, laid before me
the probabilities of success, and both he and Colonel French assured
me I should have their interest and influence in procuring
the public business of both governments.<a name="FNanchor_50_51" id="FNanchor_50_51"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_50_51" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> On my doubting
whether my father would assist me in it, Sir William said he would
give me a letter to him, in which he would state the advantages,
and he did not doubt of prevailing with him. So it was concluded
I should return to Boston in the first vessel, with the governor's
letter recommending me to my father. In the mean time the intention
was to be kept a secret, and I went on working with Keimer
as usual, the governor sending for me now and then to dine
with him, a very great honor I thought it, and conversing with
me in the most affable, familiar, and friendly manner imaginable.</p>

<p>About the end of April, 1724, a little vessel offered for Boston.
I took leave of Keimer as going to see my friends. The governor
gave me an ample letter, saying many flattering things of me to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
my father, and strongly recommending the project of my setting
up at Philadelphia as a thing that must make my fortune. We
struck on a shoal in going down the bay, and sprung a leak; we
had a blustering time at sea, and were obliged to pump almost
continually, at which I took my turn. We arrived safe, however,
at Boston in about a fortnight. I had been absent seven months,
and my friends had heard nothing of me; for my brother Holmes
was not yet returned, and had not written about me. My unexpected
appearance surprised the family; all were, however, very
glad to see me, and made me welcome, except my brother. I
went to see him at his printing house. I was better dressed than
ever while in his service, having a genteel new suit from head to
foot, a watch, and my pockets lined with near five pounds sterling
in silver. He received me not very frankly, looked me all
over, and turned to his work again.</p>

<p>The journeymen were inquisitive where I had been, what sort
of a country it was, and how I liked it. I praised it much, and
the happy life I led in it, expressing strongly my intention of returning
to it; and one of them asking what kind of money we had
there, I produced a handful of silver and spread it before them,
which was a kind of raree-show<a name="FNanchor_51_52" id="FNanchor_51_52"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_51_52" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> they had not been used to, paper
being the money of Boston. Then I took an opportunity of letting
them see my watch; and lastly (my brother still grum and sullen)
I gave them a piece of eight<a name="FNanchor_52_53" id="FNanchor_52_53"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_52_53" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> to drink, and took my leave.
This visit of mine offended him extremely; for, when my mother
some time after spoke to him of a reconciliation, and of her wishes
to see us on good terms together, and that we might live for the
future as brothers, he said I had insulted him in such a manner
before his people that he could never forget or forgive it. In
this, however, he was mistaken.</p>

<p>My father received the governor's letter with some apparent
surprise, but said little of it to me for several days, when, Captain
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Holmes returning, he showed it to him, asked him if he knew Keith,
and what kind of man he was, adding his opinion that he must
be of small discretion to think of setting a boy up in business who
wanted yet three years of being at man's estate. Holmes said
what he could in favor of the project, but my father was clear in
the impropriety of it, and at last gave a flat denial to it. Then he
wrote a civil letter to Sir William, thanking him for the patronage
he had so kindly offered me, but declining to assist me as yet in
setting up, I being, in his opinion, too young to be trusted with
the management of a business so important, and for which the
preparation must be so expensive.</p>

<p>My friend and companion, Collins, who was a clerk in the post
office, pleased with the account I gave him of my new country,
determined to go thither also; and, while I waited for my father's
determination, he set out before me by land to Rhode Island,
leaving his books, which were a pretty collection of mathematics
and natural philosophy, to come with mine and me to New York,
where he proposed to wait for me.</p>

<p>My father, though he did not approve Sir William's proposition,
was yet pleased that I had been able to obtain so advantageous
a character from a person of such note where I had resided, and
that I had been so industrious and careful as to equip myself so
handsomely in so short a time; therefore, seeing no prospect of
an accommodation between my brother and me, he gave his consent
to my returning again to Philadelphia, advised me to behave
respectfully to the people there, endeavor to obtain the general
esteem, and avoid lampooning and libeling, to which he thought
I had too much inclination; telling me that by steady industry
and a prudent parsimony I might save enough by the time I was
one and twenty to set me up; and that, if I came near the matter,
he would help me out with the rest. This was all I could
obtain, except some small gifts as tokens of his and my mother's
love, when I embarked again for New York, now with their approbation
and their blessing.</p>

<p>The sloop putting in at Newport, Rhode Island, I visited my
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
brother John, who had been married and settled there some years.
He received me very affectionately, for he always loved me. A
friend of his, one Vernon, having some money due to him in
Pennsylvania, about thirty-five pounds currency, desired I would
receive it for him, and keep it till I had his directions what to
remit it in. Accordingly, he gave me an order. This afterward
occasioned me a good deal of uneasiness.</p>

<p>At Newport we took in a number of passengers for New York,
among which were two young women, companions, and a grave,
sensible, matronlike Quaker woman, with her attendants. I had
shown an obliging readiness to do her some little services, which
impressed her, I suppose, with a degree of good will toward me;
therefore, when she saw a daily growing familiarity between me
and the two young women, which they appeared to encourage,
she took me aside, and said, "Young man, I am concerned for
thee, as thou hast no friend with thee, and seems not to know
much of the world, or of the snares youth is exposed to. Depend
upon it, those are very bad women; I can see it in all their
actions; and if thee art not upon thy guard, they will draw thee
into some danger. They are strangers to thee, and I advise thee,
in a friendly concern for thy welfare, to have no acquaintance
with them." As I seemed at first not to think so ill of them as
she did, she mentioned some things she had observed and heard
that had escaped my notice, but now convinced me she was right.
I thanked her for her kind advice, and promised to follow it.
When we arrived at New York, they told me where they lived,
and invited me to come and see them; but I avoided it, and it
was well I did; for the next day the captain missed a silver spoon
and some other things, that had been taken out of his cabin, and
he got a warrant to search their lodgings, found the stolen goods,
and had the thieves punished. So, though we had escaped a
sunken rock, which we scraped upon in the passage, I thought this
escape of rather more importance to me.</p>

<p>At New York I found my friend Collins, who had arrived there
some time before me. We had been intimate from children, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
had read the same books together; but he had the advantage of
more time for reading and studying, and a wonderful genius for
mathematical learning, in which he far outstripped me. While I
lived in Boston most of my hours of leisure for conversation were
spent with him, and he continued a sober as well as an industrious
lad, was much respected for his learning by several of the clergy
and other gentlemen, and seemed to promise making a good figure
in life. But, during my absence, he had acquired a habit of
sotting with brandy; and I found, by his own account, and what
I heard from others, that he had been drunk every day since his
arrival at New York, and behaved very oddly. He had gamed,
too, and lost his money, so that I was obliged to discharge his
lodgings, and defray his expenses to and at Philadelphia, which
proved extremely inconvenient to me.</p>

<p>The then governor of New York, Burnet (son of Bishop Burnet),
hearing from the captain that a young man, one of his passengers,
had a great many books, desired he would bring me to
see him. I waited upon him accordingly, and should have taken
Collins with me but that he was not sober. The governor treated
me with great civility, showed me his library, which was a very
large one, and we had a good deal of conversation about books
and authors. This was the second governor who had done me
the honor to take notice of me; which, to a poor boy like me,
was very pleasing.</p>

<p>We proceeded to Philadelphia. I received on the way Vernon's
money, without which we could hardly have finished our journey.
Collins wished to be employed in some countinghouse; but,
whether they discovered his dramming by his breath or by his
behavior, though he had some recommendations he met with no
success in any application, and continued lodging and boarding
at the same house with me and at my expense. Knowing I had
that money of Vernon's, he was continually borrowing of me, still
promising repayment as soon as he should be in business. At
length he had got so much of it that I was distressed to think
what I should do in case of being called on to remit it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
    His drinking continued, about which we sometimes quarreled;
for, when a little intoxicated, he was very fractious. Once, in a
boat on the Delaware with some other young men, he refused to
row in his turn. "I will be rowed home," says he. "We will not
row you," says I. "You must, or stay all night on the water,"
says he; "just as you please." The others said, "Let us row;
what signifies it?" But, my mind being soured with his other
conduct, I continued to refuse. So he swore he would make
me row, or throw me overboard; and coming along, stepping on
the thwarts,<a name="FNanchor_53_54" id="FNanchor_53_54"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_53_54" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> toward me, when he came up and struck at me I
clutched him, and, rising, pitched him headforemost into the river.
I knew he was a good swimmer, and so was under little concern
about him; but before he could get round to lay hold of the boat,
we had with a few strokes pulled her out of his reach; and ever
when he drew near the boat, we asked if he would row, striking
a few strokes to slide her away from him. He was ready to die
with vexation, and obstinately would not promise to row. However,
seeing him at last beginning to tire, we lifted him in and
brought him home dripping wet in the evening. We hardly exchanged
a civil word afterward, and a West India captain, who
had a commission to procure a tutor for the sons of a gentleman
at Barbadoes, happening to meet with him, agreed to carry him
thither. He left me then, promising to remit me the first money
he should receive in order to discharge the debt; but I never
heard of him after.</p>

<p>The breaking into this money of Vernon's was one of the first
great errata of my life; and this affair showed that my father was
not much out in his judgment when he supposed me too young
to manage business of importance. But Sir William, on reading
his letter, said he was too prudent. There was great difference
in persons, and discretion did not always accompany years, nor
was youth always without it. "And since he will not set you
up," says he, "I will do it myself. Give me an inventory of the
things necessary to be had from England, and I will send for them.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
You shall repay me when you are able; I am resolved to have a
good printer here, and I am sure you must succeed." This was
spoken with such an appearance of cordiality that I had not the
least doubt of his meaning what he said. I had hitherto kept the
proposition of my setting up a secret in Philadelphia, and I still
kept it. Had it been known that I depended on the governor,
probably some friend that knew him better would have advised
me not to rely on him, as I afterward heard it as his known
character to be liberal of promises which he never meant to keep.
Yet, unsolicited as he was by me, how could I think his generous
offers insincere? I believed him one of the best men in the
world.<a name="FNanchor_54_55" id="FNanchor_54_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_55" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>I presented him an inventory of a little printing house, amounting,
by my computation, to about one hundred pounds sterling.
He liked it, but asked me if my being on the spot in England to
choose the types, and see that everything was good of the kind,
might not be of some advantage. "Then," says he, "when there
you may make acquaintances, and establish correspondences in
the bookselling and stationery way." I agreed that this might
be advantageous. "Then," says he, "get yourself ready to go
with Annis,"<a name="FNanchor_55_56" id="FNanchor_55_56"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_55_56" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> which was the annual ship, and the only one at
that time usually passing between London and Philadelphia. But
it would be some months before Annis sailed, so I continued working
with Keimer, fretting about the money Collins had got from
me, and in daily apprehensions of being called upon by Vernon;
which, however, did not happen for some years after.</p>

<p>I believe I have omitted mentioning that, in my first voyage
from Boston, being becalmed off Block Island, our people set
about catching cod, and hauled up a good many. Hitherto I had
stuck to my resolution of not eating animal food; and on this occasion
I considered, with my master Tryon, the taking every fish
as a kind of unprovoked murder, since none of them had, or ever
could, do us any injury that might justify the slaughter. All this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
seemed very reasonable; but I had formerly been a great lover
of fish, and when this came hot out of the frying pan it smelled
admirably well. I balanced some time between principle and inclination,
till I recollected that, when the fish were opened, I saw
smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought I, "If you
eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you." So I dined
upon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people,
returning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet. So
convenient a thing it is to be a "reasonable" creature, since it enables
one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind
to do.</p>

<p>Keimer and I lived on a pretty good, familiar footing, and
agreed tolerably well, for he suspected nothing of my setting up.
He retained a great deal of his old enthusiasms, and loved argumentation.
We therefore had many disputations. I used to
work him so with my Socratic method, and had trepanned<a name="FNanchor_56_57" id="FNanchor_56_57"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_56_57" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> him
so often by questions apparently so distant from any point we
had in hand and yet by degrees led to the point, and brought
him into difficulties and contradictions, that at last he grew ridiculously
cautious, and would hardly answer me the most common
question without asking first, "What do you intend to infer from
that?" However, it gave him so high an opinion of my abilities
in the confuting way that he seriously proposed my being his colleague
in a project he had of setting up a new sect. He was
to preach the doctrines, and I was to confound all opponents.
When he came to explain with me upon the doctrines, I found
several conundrums which I objected to, unless I might have my
way a little too, and introduce some of mine.</p>

<p>Keimer wore his beard at full length, because somewhere in
the Mosaic law it is said, "Thou shalt not mar the corners of thy
beard."<a name="FNanchor_57_58" id="FNanchor_57_58"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_57_58" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> He likewise kept the seventh day Sabbath; and these
two points were essentials with him. I disliked both, but agreed
to admit them upon condition of his adopting the doctrine of using
no animal food. "I doubt," said he, "my constitution will not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
bear that." I assured him it would, and that he would be better
for it. He was usually a great glutton, and I promised myself
some diversion in half starving him. He agreed to try the practice
if I would keep him company. I did so, and we held it for
three months. We had our victuals dressed and brought to us
regularly by a woman in the neighborhood, who had from me a
list of forty dishes, to be prepared for us at different times, in all
which there was neither fish, flesh, nor fowl; and the whim suited
me the better at this time from the cheapness of it, not costing us
above eighteen pence sterling each per week. I have since kept
several Lents most strictly, leaving the common diet for that, and
that for the common, abruptly, without the least inconvenience, so
that I think there is little in the advice of making those changes
by easy gradations. I went on pleasantly, but poor Keimer suffered
grievously, tired of the project, longed for the flesh pots of
Egypt, and ordered a roast pig. He invited me and two women
friends to dine with him; but, it being brought too soon upon
table, he could not resist the temptation, and ate the whole before
we came.</p>

<p>I had made some courtship during this time to Miss Read. I
had a great respect and affection for her, and had some reason
to believe she had the same for me; but, as I was about to take
a long voyage, and we were both very young,&mdash;only a little above
eighteen,&mdash;it was thought most prudent by her mother to prevent
our going too far at present, as a marriage, if it was to take place,
would be more convenient after my return, when I should be, as
I expected, set up in my business. Perhaps, too, she thought my
expectations not so well founded as I imagined them to be.</p>

<p>My chief acquaintances at this time were Charles Osborne,
Joseph Watson, and James Ralph, all lovers of reading. The two
first were clerks to an eminent scrivener or conveyancer in the
town, Charles Brogden; the other was clerk to a merchant.
Watson was a pious, sensible young man, of great integrity; the
others rather more lax in their principles of religion, particularly
Ralph, who, as well as Collins, had been unsettled by me, for which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
they both made me suffer. Osborne was sensible, candid, frank;
sincere and affectionate to his friends, but, in literary matters, too
fond of criticising. Ralph was ingenious, genteel in his manners,
and extremely eloquent; I think I never knew a prettier talker.
Both of them were great admirers of poetry, and began to try their
hands in little pieces. Many pleasant walks we four had together
on Sundays into the woods, near Schuylkill, where we read to one
another and conferred on what we read.</p>

<p>Ralph was inclined to pursue the study of poetry, not doubting
but he might become eminent in it, and make his fortune by it,
alleging that the best poets must, when they first began to write,
make as many faults as he did. Osborne dissuaded him, assured
him he had no genius for poetry, and advised him to think of
nothing beyond the business he was bred to; that, in the mercantile
way, though he had no stock, he might, by his diligence and
punctuality, recommend himself to employment as a factor,
    <a name="FNanchor_58_59" id="FNanchor_58_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_59" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and
in time acquire wherewith to trade on his own account. I approved
the amusing one's self with poetry now and then, so far
as to improve one's language, but no farther.</p>

<p>On this it was proposed that we should each of us, at our next
meeting, produce a piece of our own composing, in order to improve
by our mutual observations, criticisms, and corrections. As
language and expression were what we had in view, we excluded
all considerations of invention by agreeing that the task should be
a version of the eighteenth Psalm, which describes the descent of
Deity. When the time of our meeting grew nigh, Ralph called
on me first, and let me know his piece was ready. I told him I
had been busy, and, having little inclination, had done nothing.
He then showed me his piece for my opinion, and I much approved
it, as it appeared to me to have great merit. "Now,"
says he, "Osborne never will allow the least merit in anything of
mine, but makes a thousand criticisms out of mere envy. He is
not so jealous of you; I wish, therefore, you would take this piece,
and produce it as yours; I will pretend not to have had time, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
so produce nothing. We shall then see what he will say to it."
It was agreed, and I immediately transcribed it that it might appear
in my own hand.</p>

<p>We met; Watson's performance was read; there were some
beauties in it, but many defects. Osborne's was read; it was much
better; Ralph did it justice; remarked some faults, but applauded
the beauties. He himself had nothing to produce. I was backward;
seemed desirous of being excused; had not had sufficient
time to correct, etc. But no excuse would be admitted; produce
I must. It was read and repeated; Watson and Osborne gave
up the contest, and joined in applauding it. Ralph only made
some criticisms, and proposed some amendments; but I defended
my text. Osborne was against Ralph, and told him he was no
better a critic than poet, so he dropped the argument. As they
two went home together, Osborne expressed himself still more
strongly in favor of what he thought my production, having restrained
himself before, as he said, lest I should think it flattery.
"But who would have imagined," said he, "that Franklin had
been capable of such a performance; such painting, such force,
such fire! He has even improved the original. In his common
conversation he seems to have no choice of words; he hesitates
and blunders; and yet, good heavens! how he writes!" When
we next met, Ralph discovered the trick we had played him, and
Osborne was a little laughed at.</p>

<p>This transaction fixed Ralph in his resolution of becoming a
poet. I did all I could to dissuade him from it, but he continued
scribbling verses till Pope cured him.<a name="FNanchor_59_60" id="FNanchor_59_60"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_59_60" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> He became, however, a
pretty good prose writer. More of him hereafter. But, as I may
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
not have occasion again to mention the other two, I shall just remark
here that Watson died in my arms a few years after, much
lamented, being the best of our set. Osborne went to the West
Indies, where he became an eminent lawyer and made money,
but died young. He and I had made a serious agreement that
the one who happened first to die should, if possible, make a
friendly visit to the other, and acquaint him how he found things
in that separate state. But he never fulfilled his promise.</p>

<p>The governor, seeming to like my company, had me frequently
to his house, and his setting me up was always mentioned as a
fixed thing. I was to take with me letters recommendatory to a
number of his friends, besides the letter of credit to furnish me
with the necessary money for purchasing the press and types,
paper, etc. For these letters I was appointed to call at different
times, when they were to be ready; but a future time was still
named. Thus he went on till the ship, whose departure, too, had
been several times postponed, was on the point of sailing. Then,
when I called to take my leave and receive the letters, his secretary,
Dr. Baird, came out to me and said the governor was extremely
busy in writing, but would be down at Newcastle before
the ship, and there the letters would be delivered to me.</p>

<p>Ralph, though married, and having one child, had determined
to accompany me on this voyage. It was thought he intended to
establish a correspondence, and obtain goods to sell on commission;
but I found afterward that, through some discontent with
his wife's relations, he proposed to leave her on their hands, and
never return again. Having taken leave of my friends, and interchanged
some promises with Miss Read, I left Philadelphia in
the ship, which anchored at Newcastle. The governor was there;
but when I went to his lodging, the secretary came to me from
him with the civilest message in the world, that he could not then
see me, being engaged in business of the utmost importance, but
should send the letters to me on board, and wished me heartily a
good voyage and a speedy return, etc. I returned on board a
little puzzled, but still not doubting.</p>

<h2>§ 3. FIRST VISIT TO LONDON.</h2>

<p>Mr. Andrew Hamilton, a Famous Lawyer of Philadelphia,
Had Taken Passage in the same ship for himself and
son, and with Mr. Denham, a Quaker merchant, and Messrs. Onion
and Russel, masters of an iron work in Maryland, had engaged
the great cabin; so that Ralph and I were forced to take up with
a berth in the steerage, and, none on board knowing us, were considered
as ordinary persons. But Mr. Hamilton and his son (it
was James, since governor) returned from Newcastle to Philadelphia,
the father being recalled by a great fee to plead for a
seized ship; and, just before we sailed, Colonel French coming
on board, and showing me great respect, I was more taken notice
of, and, with my friend Ralph, invited by the other gentlemen to
come into the cabin, there being now room. Accordingly, we
removed thither.</p>

<p>Understanding that Colonel French had brought on board the
governor's dispatches, I asked the captain for those letters that
were to be put under my care. He said all were put into the bag
together, and he could not then come at them; but, before we
landed in England, I should have an opportunity of picking them
out; so I was satisfied for the present, and we proceeded on our
voyage. We had a sociable company in the cabin, and lived uncommonly
well, having the addition of all Mr. Hamilton's stores,
who had laid in plentifully. In this passage Mr. Denham contracted
a friendship for me that continued during his life. The
voyage was otherwise not a pleasant one, as we had a great deal
of bad weather.</p>

<p>When we came into the Channel the captain kept his word with
me, and gave me an opportunity of examining the bag for the
governor's letters. I found none upon which my name was put
as under my care. I picked out six or seven, that, by the handwriting,
I thought might be the promised letters, especially as one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of them was directed to Basket, the king's printer, and another to
some stationer.</p>

<p>We arrived in London the 24th of December, 1724. I waited
upon the stationer, who came first in my way, delivering the letter
as from Governor Keith. "I don't know such a person," says
he; but, opening the letter, "Oh! this is from Riddlesden. I
have lately found him to be a complete rascal, and I will have
nothing to do with him, nor receive any letters from him." So,
putting the letter into my hand, he turned on his heel and left me,
to serve some customer. I was surprised to find these were not
the governor's letters; and, after recollecting and comparing circumstances,
I began to doubt his sincerity. I found my friend
Denham, and opened the whole affair to him. He let me into
Keith's character; told me there was not the least probability that
he had written any letters for me; that no one who knew him had
the smallest dependence on him; and he laughed at the notion
of the governor's giving me a letter of credit, having, as he said,
no credit to give. On my expressing some concern about what
I should do, he advised me to endeavor getting some employment
in the way of my business. "Among the printers here," said he,
"you will improve yourself, and when you return to America you
will set up to greater advantage."</p>

<p>We both of us happened to know, as well as the stationer, that
Riddlesden, the attorney, was a very knave. He had half ruined
Miss Read's father by persuading him to be bound<a name="FNanchor_60_61" id="FNanchor_60_61"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_60_61" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> for him. By
this letter it appeared there was a secret scheme on foot to the
prejudice of Hamilton (supposed to be then coming over with
us), and that Keith was concerned in it with Riddlesden. Denham,
who was a friend of Hamilton's, thought he ought to be
acquainted with it; so, when he arrived in England, which was
soon after, partly from resentment and ill will to Keith and Riddlesden
and partly from good will to him, I waited on him, and
gave him the letter. He thanked me cordially, the information
being of importance to him; and from that time he became

<a name="my" id="my"></a>my friend, greatly to my advantage afterward on many occasions.</p>

<p>But what shall we think of a governor's playing such pitiful
tricks, and imposing so grossly on a poor ignorant boy! It was
a habit he had acquired. He wished to please everybody; and,
having little to give, he gave expectations. He was otherwise an
ingenious, sensible man, a pretty good writer, and a good governor
for the people, though not for his constituents, the proprietaries,
    <a name="FNanchor_61_62" id="FNanchor_61_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_62" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
whose instructions he sometimes disregarded. Several of
our best laws were of his planning, and passed during his administration.</p>

<p>Ralph and I were inseparable companions. We took lodgings
together in Little Britain<a name="FNanchor_62_63" id="FNanchor_62_63"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_62_63" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> at three shillings and sixpence a week,&mdash;as
much as we could then afford. He found some relations,
but they were poor, and unable to assist him. He now let me
know his intentions of remaining in London, and that he never
meant to return to Philadelphia. He had brought no money with
him, the whole he could muster having been expended in paying
his passage. I had fifteen pistoles;<a name="FNanchor_63_64" id="FNanchor_63_64"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_63_64" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> so he borrowed occasionally
of me to subsist while he was looking out for business. He
first endeavored to get into the playhouse, believing himself qualified
for an actor; but Wilkes,<a name="FNanchor_64_65" id="FNanchor_64_65"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_64_65" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> to whom he applied, advised him
candidly not to think of that employment, as it was impossible
he should succeed in it. Then he proposed to Roberts, a publisher
in Paternoster Row, to write for him a weekly paper like
the "Spectator," on certain conditions which Roberts did not approve.
Then he endeavored to get employment as a hackney
writer,<a name="FNanchor_65_66" id="FNanchor_65_66"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_65_66" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> to copy for the stationers
    and lawyers about the Temple,<a name="FNanchor_66_67" id="FNanchor_66_67"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_66_67" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
but could find no vacancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
    I immediately got into work at Palmer's, then a famous printing
house in Bartholomew Close, and here I continued near a year.
I was pretty diligent, but spent with Ralph a good deal of my
earnings in going to plays and other places of amusement. We
had together consumed all my pistoles, and now just rubbed on
from hand to mouth. He seemed quite to forget his wife and
child, and I, by degrees, my engagements with Miss Read, to
whom I never wrote more than one letter, and that was to let her
know I was not likely soon to return. This was another of the
great errata of my life, which I should wish to correct if I were
to live it over again. In fact, by our expenses I was constantly
kept unable to pay my passage.</p>

<p>At Palmer's I was employed in composing<a name="FNanchor_67_68" id="FNanchor_67_68"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_67_68" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> for the second edition
of Wollaston's "Religion of Nature." Some of his reasonings
not appearing to me well founded, I wrote a little metaphysical
piece, in which I made remarks on them. It was entitled,
"Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain." I
inscribed it to my friend Ralph; I printed a small number. It
occasioned my being more considered by Mr. Palmer as a young
man of some ingenuity, though he seriously expostulated with
me upon the principles of my pamphlet, which to him appeared
abominable. My printing this pamphlet was another erratum.</p>

<p>While I lodged in Little Britain I made an acquaintance with
one Wilcox, a bookseller, whose shop was at the next door. He
had an immense collection of secondhand books. Circulating
libraries were not then in use; but we agreed that, on certain reasonable
terms, which I have now forgotten, I might take, read,
and return any of his books. This I esteemed a great advantage,
and I made as much use of it as I could.</p>

<p>My pamphlet falling into the hands of one Lyons, a surgeon,
author of a book entitled "The Infallibility of Human Judgment,"
it occasioned an acquaintance between us. He took great notice
of me, called on me often to converse on those subjects, carried
me to the Horns, a pale-ale house in &mdash;&mdash; Lane, Cheapside, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
introduced me to Dr. Mandeville, author of the "Fable of the
Bees," who had a club there, of which he was the soul, being
a most facetious, entertaining companion. Lyons, too, introduced
me to Dr. Pemberton, at Batson's Coffee-house, who promised
to give me an opportunity, some time or other, of seeing Sir
Isaac Newton, of which I was extremely desirous; but this never
happened.</p>

<p>I had brought over a few curiosities, among which the principal
was a purse made of the asbestos, which purifies by fire. Sir
Hans Sloane<a name="FNanchor_68_69" id="FNanchor_68_69"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_68_69" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> heard of it, came to see me, and invited me to his
house in Bloomsbury Square, where he showed me all his curiosities,
and persuaded me to let him add that to the number, for
which he paid me handsomely.</p>

<p>In our house there lodged a young woman, a milliner, who, I
think, had a shop in the Cloisters. She had been genteelly bred,
was sensible and lively, and of most pleasing conversation. Ralph
read plays to her in the evenings; they grew intimate; she took
another lodging, and he followed her. They lived together some
time; but, he being still out of business, and her income not sufficient
to maintain them with her child, he took a resolution of
going from London to try for a country school, which he thought
himself well qualified to undertake, as he wrote an excellent hand,
and was a master of arithmetic and accounts. This, however,
he deemed a business below him; and, confident of future better
fortune, when he should be unwilling to have it known that he
once was so meanly employed, he changed his name, and did
me the honor to assume mine; for I soon after had a letter from
him, acquainting me that he was settled in a small village, (in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Berkshire, I think it was, where he taught reading and writing to
ten or a dozen boys, at sixpence each per week,) recommending
Mrs. T&mdash;&mdash; to my care, and desiring me to write to him, directing
for Mr. Franklin, Schoolmaster, at such a place.</p>

<p>He continued to write frequently, sending me large specimens
of an epic poem which he was then composing, and desiring my
remarks and corrections. These I gave him from time to time,
but endeavored rather to discourage his proceeding. One of
Young's<a name="FNanchor_N_7" id="FNanchor_N_7"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_7" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> satires was then just published. I copied and sent him
a great part of it, which set in a strong light the folly of pursuing
the Muses with any hope of advancement by them. All was in
vain; sheets of the poem continued to come by every post.</p>

<p>A breach at last arose between us; and, when he returned again
to London, he let me know he thought I had canceled all the
obligations he had been under to me. So I found I was never to
expect his repaying me what I lent to him or advanced for him.
This, however, was not then of much consequence, as he was
totally unable; and in the loss of his friendship I found myself
relieved from a burden. I now began to think of getting a little
money beforehand; and, expecting better work, I left Palmer's to
work at Watts's, near Lincoln's Inn Fields, a still greater printing
house. Here I continued all the rest of my stay in London.</p>

<p>At my first admission into this printing house I took to working
at press,<a name="FNanchor_69_70" id="FNanchor_69_70"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_69_70" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I had
been used to in America, where press work is mixed with composing.
I drank only water; the other workmen, near fifty in number,
were great guzzlers of beer. On occasion, I carried up and
down stairs a large form of types in each hand, when others carried
but one in both hands. They wondered to see, from this
and several instances, that the "Water-American," as they called
me, was stronger than themselves, who drank strong beer! We
had an alehouse boy who attended always in the house to supply
the workmen. My companion at the press drank every day
a pint before breakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
cheese, a pint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a
pint in the afternoon about six o'clock, and another when he had
done his day's work. I thought it a detestable custom; but it
was necessary, he supposed, to drink strong beer that he might be
strong to labor. I endeavored to convince him that the bodily
strength afforded by beer could only be in proportion to the
grain or flour of the barley dissolved in the water of which it
was made; that there was more flour in a pennyworth of bread;
and therefore, if he would eat that with a pint of water, it would
give him more strength than a quart of beer. He drank on, however,
and had four or five shillings to pay out of his wages every
Saturday night for that muddling liquor&mdash;an expense I was free
from. And thus these poor devils keep themselves always under.</p>

<p>Watts after some weeks desiring to have me in the composing
room, I left the pressmen; a new <i>bien venu</i>,
    <a name="FNanchor_70_71" id="FNanchor_70_71"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_70_71" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> or sum for drink,
being five shillings, was demanded of me by the compositors. I
thought it an imposition, as I had paid below; the master thought
so too, and forbade my paying it. I stood out two or three
weeks, was accordingly considered as an excommunicate, and had
so many little pieces of private mischief done me, by mixing my
sorts,<a name="FNanchor_71_72" id="FNanchor_71_72"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_71_72" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> transposing my pages,
    breaking my matter, etc., if I were
ever so little out of the room, and all ascribed to the chapel
    <a name="FNanchor_72_73" id="FNanchor_72_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_73" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
ghost, which they said ever haunted those not regularly admitted,
that, notwithstanding the master's protection, I found myself
obliged to comply and pay the money, convinced of the folly of
being on ill terms with those one is to live with continually.</p>

<p>I was now on a fair footing with them, and soon acquired considerable
influence. I proposed some reasonable alterations in
their chapel laws, and carried them against all opposition. From
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
my example, a great part of them left their muddling breakfast of
beer and bread and cheese, finding they could with me be supplied
from a neighboring house with a large porringer of hot
water gruel, sprinkled with pepper, crumbed with bread, and a bit
of butter in it, for the price of a pint of beer, namely, three halfpence.
This was a more comfortable as well as cheaper breakfast,
and kept their heads clearer. Those who continued sotting
with beer all day were often, by not paying, out of credit at the
alehouse, and used to make interest with me to get beer, their
"light," as they phrased it, "being out." I watched the pay table
on Saturday night, and collected what I stood engaged for them,
having to pay sometimes near thirty shillings a week on their accounts.
This, and my being esteemed a pretty good "riggite,"&mdash;that
is, a jocular verbal satirist,&mdash;supported my consequence in the society.
My constant attendance (I never making a Saint Monday
    <a name="FNanchor_73_74" id="FNanchor_73_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_74" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>)
recommended me to the master; and my uncommon quickness
at composing occasioned my being put upon all work of dispatch,
which was generally better paid. So I went on now very
agreeably.</p>

<p>My lodging in Little Britain being too remote, I found another
in Duke Street, opposite to the Romish Chapel. It was two pair
of stairs backward, at an Italian warehouse. A widow lady kept
the house; she had a daughter, and a maidservant, and a journeyman
who attended the warehouse, but lodged abroad. After
sending to inquire my character at the house where I last lodged,
she agreed to take me in at the same rate, three shillings and sixpence
per week; cheaper, as she said, from the protection she expected
in having a man lodge in the house. She was a widow, an
elderly woman; had been bred a Protestant, being a clergyman's
daughter, but was converted to the Catholic religion by her husband,
whose memory she much revered; had lived much among
people of distinction, and knew a thousand anecdotes of them as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
far back as the time of Charles II. She was lame in her knees
with the gout, and, therefore, seldom stirred out of her room, so
sometimes wanted company; and hers was so highly amusing
to me that I was sure to spend an evening with her whenever she
desired it. Our supper was only half an anchovy each, on a very
little strip of bread and butter, and half a pint of ale between us;
but the entertainment was in her conversation. My always keeping
good hours, and giving little trouble in the family, made her
unwilling to part with me; so that, when I talked of a lodging I
had heard of, nearer my business, for two shillings a week, which,
intent as I now was on saving money, made some difference, she
bid me not think of it, for she would abate me two shillings a
week for the future; so I remained with her at one shilling and
sixpence as long as I stayed in London.</p>

<p>In a garret of her house there lived a maiden lady of seventy,
in the most retired manner, of whom my landlady gave me this
account: she was a Roman Catholic, had been sent abroad when
young, and lodged in a nunnery with an intent of becoming
a nun; but, the country not agreeing with her, she returned to
England, where, there being no nunnery, she had vowed to lead
the life of a nun, as near as might be done in those circumstances.
Accordingly, she had given all her estate to charitable
uses, reserving only twelve pounds a year to live on, and out of
this sum she still gave a great deal in charity, living herself on
water gruel only, and using no fire but to boil it. She had lived
many years in that garret, being permitted to remain there gratis
by successive Catholic tenants of the house below, as they
deemed it a blessing to have her there. A priest visited her to
confess her every day. "I have asked her," says my landlady,
"how she, as she lived, could possibly find so much employment
for a confessor." "Oh," said she, "it is impossible to avoid vain
thoughts." I was permitted once to visit her. She was cheerful
and polite, and conversed pleasantly. The room was clean, but
had no other furniture than a mattress, a table with a crucifix and
book, a stool which she gave me to sit on, and a picture over the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
chimney of St. Veronica<a name="FNanchor_74_75" id="FNanchor_74_75"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_74_75" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> displaying her handkerchief, with the
miraculous figure of Christ's bleeding face on it, which she explained
to me with great seriousness. She looked pale, but was
never sick; and I give it as another instance on how small an income
life and health may be supported.</p>

<p>At Watts's printing house I contracted an acquaintance with
an ingenious young man, one Wygate, who, having wealthy relations,
had been better educated than most printers,&mdash;was a tolerable
Latinist, spoke French, and loved reading. I taught him
and a friend of his to swim at twice going into the river, and they
soon became good swimmers. They introduced me to some gentlemen
from the country, who went to Chelsea<a name="FNanchor_75_76" id="FNanchor_75_76"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_75_76" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> by water to see
the college and Don Saltero's<a name="FNanchor_76_77" id="FNanchor_76_77"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_76_77" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> curiosities. In our return, at the
request of the company, whose curiosity Wygate had excited, I
stripped and leaped into the river, and swam from near Chelsea
to Blackfriar's,<a name="FNanchor_77_78" id="FNanchor_77_78"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_77_78" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> performing on the way many feats of activity,
both upon and under the water, that surprised and pleased those
to whom they were novelties.</p>

<p>I had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise, had
studied and practiced all Thevenot's motions and positions, and
added some of my own, aiming at the graceful and easy as well as
the useful. All these I took this occasion of exhibiting to the company,
and was much flattered by their admiration; and Wygate,
who was desirous of becoming a master, grew more and more attached
to me on that account, as well as from the similarity of
our studies. He at length proposed to me traveling all over
Europe together, supporting ourselves everywhere by working at
our business. I was once inclined to it; but, mentioning it to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
my good friend, Mr. Denham, with whom I often spent an hour
when I had leisure, he dissuaded me from it, advising me to think
only of returning to Pennsylvania, which he was now about to do.</p>

<p>I must record one trait of this good man's character. He had
formerly been in business at Bristol, but failed, in debt to a number
of people, compounded, and went to America. There, by a
close application to business as a merchant, he acquired a plentiful
fortune in a few years. Returning to England in the ship with
me, he invited his old creditors to an entertainment, at which he
thanked them for the easy composition<a name="FNanchor_78_79" id="FNanchor_78_79"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_78_79" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> they had favored him
with, and, when they expected nothing but the treat, every man
at the first remove found under his plate an order on a banker
for the full amount of the unpaid remainder, with interest.</p>

<p>He now told me he was about to return to Philadelphia, and
should carry over a great quantity of goods, in order to open a
store there. He proposed to take me over as his clerk, to keep
his books (in which he would instruct me), copy his letters, and
attend the store. He added that, as soon as I should be acquainted
with mercantile business, he would promote me by sending
me with a cargo of flour and bread, etc., to the West Indies,
and procure me commissions from others which would be profitable;
and, if I managed well, would establish me handsomely.
The thing pleased me, for I was grown tired of London, remembered
with pleasure the happy months I had spent in Pennsylvania,
and wished again to see it; therefore I immediately agreed
on the terms of fifty pounds a year, Pennsylvania money; less,
indeed, than my present gettings as a compositor, but affording
a better prospect.</p>

<p>I now took leave of printing, as I thought, forever, and was
daily employed in my new business, going about with Mr. Denham
among the tradesmen to purchase various articles, and seeing
them packed up, doing errands, calling upon workmen to
dispatch, etc.; and, when all was on board, I had a few days'
leisure. On one of these days, I was, to my surprise, sent for by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
a great man I knew only by name, a Sir William Wyndham, and
I waited upon him. He had heard by some means or other of
my swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriar's, and of my teaching
Wygate and another young man to swim in a few hours. He
had two sons about to set out on their travels; he wished to have
them first taught swimming, and proposed to gratify<a name="FNanchor_79_80" id="FNanchor_79_80"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_79_80" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> me handsomely
if I would teach them. They were not yet come to town,
and my stay was uncertain, so I could not undertake it; but from
this incident I thought it likely that, if I were to remain in England
and open a swimming school, I might get a good deal of
money; and it struck me so strongly that, had the overture been
sooner made me, probably I should not so soon have returned to
America. After many years, you and I had something of more
importance to do with one of these sons of Sir William Wyndham,
become Earl of Egremont, which I shall mention in its
place.</p>

<p>Thus I spent about eighteen months in London; most part of
the time I worked hard at my business, and spent but little upon
myself except in seeing plays and in books. My friend Ralph
had kept me poor; he owed me about twenty-seven pounds,
which I was now never likely to receive,&mdash;a great sum out of my
small earnings! I loved him, notwithstanding, for he had many
amiable qualities. I had by no means improved my fortune;
but I had picked up some very ingenious acquaintance, whose
conversation was of great advantage to me; and I had read considerably.</p>

<p>We sailed from Gravesend on the 23d of July, 1726. For the
incidents of the voyage I refer you to my journal, where you will
find them all minutely related. Perhaps the most important part
of that journal is the plan<a name="FNanchor_80_81" id="FNanchor_80_81"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_80_81" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> to be found in it, which I formed at
sea, for regulating my future conduct in life. It is the more remarkable,
as being formed when I was so young, and yet being
pretty faithfully adhered to quite through to old age.</p>

<h2>§ 4. IN PHILADELPHIA AND IN BUSINESS FOR HIMSELF.</h2>

<p>We landed in Philadelphia on the 11th of October, where I
found sundry alterations. Keith was no longer governor,
being superseded by Major Gordon. I met him walking the streets
as a common citizen. He seemed a little ashamed at seeing me,
but passed without saying anything. I should have been as much
ashamed at seeing Miss Read, had not her friends, despairing
with reason of my return after the receipt of my letter, persuaded
her to marry another, one Rogers, a potter, which was done in
my absence. With him, however, she was never happy, and
soon parted from him, refusing to bear his name, it being now
said that he had another wife. He was a worthless fellow,
though an excellent workman, which was the temptation to her
friends. He got into debt, ran away in 1727 or 1728, went to
the West Indies, and died there. Keimer had got a better house,
a shop well supplied with stationery, plenty of new types, a
number of hands, though none good, and seemed to have a great
deal of business.</p>

<p>Mr. Denham took a store in Water Street, where we opened
our goods; I attended the business diligently, studied accounts,
and grew, in a little time, expert at selling. We lodged and
boarded together; he counseled me as a father, having a sincere
regard for me. I respected and loved him, and we might have
gone on together very happy; but, in the beginning of February,
1726/7,<a name="FNanchor_81_82" id="FNanchor_81_82"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_81_82" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> when I had just passed my
    twenty-first year, we were both
taken ill. My distemper was a pleurisy, which very nearly carried
me off. I suffered a good deal, gave up the point in my own
mind, and was rather disappointed when I found myself recovering,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<a name="regret" id="regret"></a>regretting, in some degree, that I must now, some time or
other, have all that disagreeable work to do over again. I forget
what his distemper was; it held him a long time, and at length
carried him off. He left me a small legacy in a nuncupative
    <a name="FNanchor_82_83" id="FNanchor_82_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_83" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> will,
as a token of his kindness for me, and he left me once more to
the wide world; for the store was taken into the care of his executors,
and my employment under him ended.</p>

<p>My brother-in-law, Holmes, being now at Philadelphia, advised
my return to my business; and Keimer tempted me, with an offer
of large wages by the year, to come and take the management
of his printing house, that he might better attend his stationer's
shop. I had heard a bad character of him in London from his
wife and her friends, and was not fond of having any more to do
with him. I tried for further employment as a merchant's clerk;
but, not readily meeting with any, I closed again with Keimer.
I found in his house these hands: Hugh Meredith, a Welsh
Pennsylvanian, thirty years of age, bred to country work; honest,
sensible, had a great deal of solid observation, was something of
a reader, but given to drink. Stephen Potts, a young countryman
of full age, bred to the same, of uncommon natural parts,
and great wit and humor, but a little idle. These he had agreed
with at extremely low wages per week, to be raised a shilling
every three months, as they would deserve by improving in their
business; and the expectation of these high wages, to come on
hereafter, was what he had drawn them in with. Meredith was
to work at press, Potts at bookbinding, which he, by agreement,
was to teach them, though he knew neither one nor the other.
John &mdash;&mdash;, a wild Irishman, brought up to no business, whose
service, for four years, Keimer had purchased<a name="FNanchor_83_84" id="FNanchor_83_84"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_83_84" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> from the captain
of a ship; he, too, was to be made a pressman. George Webb,
an Oxford scholar, whose time for four years he had likewise
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
bought, intending him for a compositor, of whom more presently;
and David Harry, a country boy, whom he had taken apprentice.</p>

<p>I soon perceived that the intention of engaging me at wages
so much higher than he had been used to give was to have these
raw, cheap hands formed through me; and, as soon as I had instructed
them, then they being all articled<a name="FNanchor_84_85" id="FNanchor_84_85"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_84_85" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> to him, he should be
able to do without me. I went on, however, very cheerfully, put
his printing house in order, which had been in great confusion,
and brought his hands by degrees to mind their business and to
do it better.</p>

<p>It was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situation
of a bought servant. He was not more than eighteen years
of age, and gave me this account of himself: he was born in
Gloucester, educated at a grammar school there, and had been distinguished
among the scholars for some apparent superiority in
performing his part when they exhibited plays. He belonged to
the Witty Club there, and had written some pieces in prose and
verse, which were printed in the Gloucester newspapers. Thence
he was sent to Oxford, where he continued about a year, but not
well satisfied, wishing of all things to see London, and become a
player. At length, receiving his quarterly allowance of fifteen
guineas,<a name="FNanchor_85_86" id="FNanchor_85_86"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_85_86" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> instead of discharging his debts he walked out of town,
hid his gown in a furze bush, and footed it to London, where,
having no friends to advise him, he fell into bad company, soon
spent his guineas, found no means of being introduced among
the players, grew necessitous, pawned his clothes, and wanted
bread. Walking the street very hungry, and not knowing what
to do with himself, a crimp's<a name="FNanchor_86_87" id="FNanchor_86_87"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_86_87" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> bill was put into his hand, offering
immediate entertainment and encouragement to such as would
bind themselves to serve in America. He went directly, signed
the indentures, was put into the ship, and came over, never writing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
a line to acquaint his friends what was become of him. He
was lively, witty, good-natured, and a pleasant companion, but
idle, thoughtless, and imprudent to the last degree.</p>

<p>John, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to
live very agreeably, for they all respected me the more as they
found Keimer incapable of instructing them, and that from me
they learned something daily. We never worked on Saturday,
that being Keimer's Sabbath, so I had two days for reading.
My acquaintance with ingenious people in the town increased.
Keimer himself treated me with great civility and apparent regard,
and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon,
which I was yet unable to pay, being hitherto but a poor economist.
He, however, kindly made no demand of it.</p>

<p>Our printing house often wanted sorts, and there was no letter
founder in America. I had seen types cast at James's in
London, but without much attention to the manner; however, I
now contrived a mold, made use of the letters we had as puncheons,
struck the matrices<a name="FNanchor_87_88" id="FNanchor_87_88"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_87_88" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> in lead, and thus supplied in a pretty
tolerable way all deficiencies. I also engraved several things on
occasion; I made the ink; I was warehouseman,<a name="FNanchor_88_89" id="FNanchor_88_89"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_88_89" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and everything,
and, in short, quite a factotum.</p>

<p>But, however serviceable I might be, I found that my services
became every day of less importance, as the other hands improved
in the business; and when Keimer paid my second quarter's
wages he let me know that he felt them too heavy, and thought
I should make an abatement. He grew by degrees less civil, put
on more of the master, frequently found fault, was captious, and
seemed ready for an outbreaking. I went on, nevertheless, with
a good deal of patience, thinking that his encumbered circumstances
were partly the cause. At length a trifle snapped our
connections; for, a great noise happening near the courthouse,
I put my head out of the window to see what was the matter.
Keimer, being in the street, looked up and saw me, and called out
to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business, adding
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
some reproachful words that nettled me the more for their publicity,
all the neighbors, who were looking out on the same occasion,
being witnesses how I was treated. He came up immediately
into the printing house; continued the quarrel; high words
passed on both sides. He gave me the quarter's warning we had
stipulated, expressing a wish that he had not been obliged to so
long a warning. I told him that his wish was unnecessary, for
I would leave him that instant; and so, taking my hat, walked
out of doors, desiring Meredith, whom I saw below, to take care
of some things I left, and bring them to my lodgings.</p>

<p>Meredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my
affair over. He had conceived a great regard for me, and was
very unwilling that I should leave the house while he remained
in it. He dissuaded me from returning to my native country,
which I began to think of; he reminded me that Keimer was in
debt for all he possessed; that his creditors began to be uneasy;
that he kept his shop miserably, sold often without profit for
ready money, and often trusted without keeping accounts; that
he must therefore fail, which would make a vacancy I might
profit of. I objected my want of money. He then let me know
that his father had a high opinion of me, and, from some discourse
that had passed between them, he was sure would advance
money to set us up, if I would enter into partnership with him.
"My time," says he, "will be out with Keimer in the spring; by
that time we may have our press and types in from London. I
am sensible I am no workman; if you like it, your skill in the
business shall be set against the stock I furnish, and we will share
the profits equally."</p>

<p>The proposal was agreeable, and I consented. His father was
in town, and approved of it, the more as he saw I had great influence
with his son, had prevailed on him to abstain long from
dram drinking, and he hoped might break him of that wretched
habit entirely when we came to be so closely connected. I gave
an inventory to the father, who carried it to a merchant; the
things were sent for, the secret was to be kept till they should
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
arrive, and in the mean time I was to get work, if I could, at
the other printing house. But I found no vacancy there, and so
remained idle a few days, when Keimer, on a prospect of being
employed to print some paper money in New Jersey, which would
require cuts and various types that I only could supply, and apprehending
Bradford might engage me and get the job from him,
sent me a very civil message, that old friends should not part for
a few words, the effect of sudden passion, and wishing me to return.
Meredith persuaded me to comply, as it would give more
opportunity for his improvement under my daily instructions; so
I returned, and we went on more smoothly than for some time
before. The New Jersey job was obtained, I contrived a copperplate
press for it, the first that had been seen in the country;
I cut several ornaments and checks<a name="FNanchor_89_90" id="FNanchor_89_90"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_89_90" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> for the bills. We went together
to Burlington, where I executed the whole to satisfaction;
and he received so large a sum for the work as to be enabled
thereby to keep his head much longer above water.</p>

<p>At Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal
people of the province. Several of them had been appointed by
the Assembly a committee to attend the press, and take care that
no more bills were printed than the law directed. They were
therefore, by turns, constantly with us, and generally he who attended
brought with him a friend or two for company. My mind
having been much more improved by reading than Keimer's, I
suppose it was for that reason my conversation seemed to be
more valued. They had me to their houses, introduced me to
their friends, and showed me much civility; while he, though the
master, was a little neglected. In truth, he was an odd fish; ignorant
of common life, fond of rudely opposing received opinions,
slovenly to extreme dirtiness, enthusiastic in some points of religion,
and a little knavish withal.</p>

<p>We continued there near three months; and by that time I could
reckon among my acquired friends Judge Allen, Samuel Bustill,
the secretary of the province, Isaac Pearson, Joseph Cooper, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
several of the Smiths, members of Assembly, and Isaac Decow,
the surveyor general. The latter was a shrewd, sagacious old
man, who told me that he began for himself, when young, by
wheeling clay for the brickmakers, learned to write after he was
of age, carried the chain for surveyors, who taught him surveying,
and he had now by his industry acquired a good estate; and
says he, "I foresee that you will soon work this man out of his
business, and make a fortune in it at Philadelphia." He had not
then the least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere.
These friends were afterward of great use to me, as I
occasionally was to some of them. They all continued their regard
for me as long as they lived.</p>

<p>Before I enter upon my public appearance in business, it may
be well to let you know the then state of my mind with regard
to my principles and morals, that you may see how far those influenced
the future events of my life. My parents had early
given me religious impressions, and brought me through my
childhood piously in the Dissenting<a name="FNanchor_90_91" id="FNanchor_90_91"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_90_91" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> way. But I was scarce fifteen
when, after doubting by turns of several points, as I found
them disputed in the different books I read, I began to doubt of
revelation itself. Some books against Deism<a name="FNanchor_91_92" id="FNanchor_91_92"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_91_92" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> fell into my hands;
they were said to be the substance of sermons preached at Boyle's
Lectures. It happened that they wrought an effect on me quite
contrary to what was intended by them; for the arguments of
the Deists, which were quoted to be refuted, appeared to me
much stronger than the refutations; in short, I soon became a
thorough Deist. My arguments perverted some others, particularly
Collins and Ralph; but, each of them having afterward
wronged me greatly without the least compunction, and recollecting
Keith's conduct toward me (who was another freethinker),
and my own toward Vernon and Miss Read, which at times
gave me great trouble, I began to suspect that this doctrine,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
though it might be true, was not very useful. My London pamphlet,
which had for its motto these lines of Dryden:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whatever is, is right. Though purblind man<br /></span>
<span class="i00">Sees but a part o' the chain, the nearest link:<br /></span>
<span class="i00">His eyes not carrying to the equal beam<br /></span>
<span class="i00">That poises all above;"<a name="FNanchor_92_93" id="FNanchor_92_93"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_92_93" class="fnanchor">[92]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and from the attributes of God, his infinite wisdom, goodness,
and power, concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in
the world, and that vice and virtue were empty distinctions, no
such things existing, appeared now not so clever a performance
as I once thought it; and I doubted whether some error had not
insinuated itself unperceived into my argument, so as to infect all
that followed, as is common in metaphysical reasonings.</p>

<p>I grew convinced that truth, sincerity, and integrity in dealings
between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity
of life; and I formed written resolutions, which still remain
in my journal book, to practice them ever while I lived. Revelation
had indeed no weight with me as such; but I entertained
an opinion that, though certain actions might not be bad because
they were forbidden by it, or good because it commanded them,
yet probably those actions might be forbidden because they were
bad for us, or commanded because they were beneficial to us, in
their own natures, all the circumstances of things considered.
And this persuasion, with the kind hand of Providence, or some
guardian angel, or accidental favorable circumstances and situations,
or all together,&mdash;preserved me, through this dangerous time
of youth and the hazardous situations I was sometimes in among
strangers, remote from the eye and advice of my father, without
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
any willful gross immorality or injustice, that might have been
expected from my want of religion. I say willful, because the
instances I have mentioned had something of necessity in them,
from my youth, inexperience, and the knavery of others. I had,
therefore, a tolerable character to begin the world with; I valued
it properly, and determined to preserve it.</p>

<p>We had not been long returned to Philadelphia before the new
types arrived from London. We settled with Keimer, and left
him by his consent before he heard of it. We found a house to
hire near the market, and took it. To lessen the rent, which was
then but twenty-four pounds a year, though I have since known
it to let for seventy, we took in Thomas Godfrey, a glazier, and
his family, who were to pay a considerable part of it to us, and
we to board with them. We had scarce opened our letters and
put our press in order, before George House, an acquaintance of
mine, brought a countryman to us, whom he had met in the street
inquiring for a printer. All our cash was now expended in the
variety of particulars we had been obliged to procure, and this
countryman's five shillings, being our first fruits, and coming so
seasonably, gave me more pleasure than any crown I have since
earned; and the gratitude I felt toward House has made me often
more ready than perhaps I should otherwise have been to assist
young beginners.</p>

<p>There are croakers in every country, always boding its ruin.
Such a one then lived in Philadelphia, a person of note, an
elderly man, with a wise look and a very grave manner of speaking.
His name was Samuel Mickle. This gentleman, a stranger
to me, stopped one day at my door, and asked me if I was the
young man who had lately opened a new printing house. Being
answered in the affirmative, he said he was sorry for me, because
it was an expensive undertaking, and the expense would be lost;
for Philadelphia was a sinking place, the people already half
bankrupts, or near being so, all appearances to the contrary,
such as new buildings and the rise of rents, being to his certain
knowledge fallacious; for they were, in fact, among the things
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
that <a name="would" id="would"></a>would soon ruin us. And he gave me such a detail of misfortunes
now existing, or that were soon to exist, that he left me
half melancholy. Had I known him before I engaged in this
business, probably I never should have done it. This man continued
to live in this decaying place, and to declaim in the same
strain, refusing for many years to buy a house there, because all
was going to destruction; and at last I had the pleasure of seeing
him give five times as much for one as he might have bought it
for when he first began his croaking.</p>

<p>I should have mentioned before, that in the autumn of the
preceding year I had formed most of my ingenious acquaintance
into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the
"Junto."<a name="FNanchor_93_94" id="FNanchor_93_94"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_93_94" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> We met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up
required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or
more queries on any point of morals, politics, or natural philosophy,
to be discussed by the company; and once in three months
produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he
pleased. Our debates were to be under the direction of a president,
and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after
truth, without fondness for dispute or desire of victory; and, to
prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or
direct contradiction, were after some time made contraband, and
prohibited under small pecuniary penalties.<a name="FNanchor_N_8" id="FNanchor_N_8"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_8" class="fnanchor">[n]</a></p>

<p>The first members were: Joseph Breintnal, a copier of deeds
for the scriveners, a good-natured, friendly, middle-aged man, a
great lover of poetry, reading all he could meet with, and writing
some that was tolerable; very ingenious in many little knick-knackeries,
and of sensible conversation. Thomas Godfrey, a
self-taught mathematician, great in his way, and afterward inventor
of what is now called Hadley's Quadrant.<a name="FNanchor_94_95" id="FNanchor_94_95"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_94_95" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> But he
knew little out of his way, and was not a pleasing companion;
as, like most great mathematicians I have met with, he expected
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
universal precision in everything said, or was forever denying
or distinguishing upon trifles, to the disturbance of all conversation.
He soon left us. Nicholas Scull, a surveyor, afterward
surveyor general, who loved books, and sometimes made
a few verses. William Parsons, bred a shoemaker, but loving
reading, had acquired a considerable share of mathematics,
which he first studied with a view to astrology that he afterward
laughed at. He also became surveyor general. William
Maugridge, a joiner, a most exquisite mechanic, and a solid,
sensible man. Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb
I have characterized before. Robert Grace, a young gentleman
of some fortune, generous, lively, and witty; a lover of punning
and of his friends. And William Coleman, then a merchant's clerk,
about my age, who had the coolest, clearest head, the best heart,
and the exactest morals of almost any man I ever met with. He
became afterward a merchant of great note, and one of our provincial
judges. Our friendship continued without interruption to
his death, upward of forty years; and the club continued almost
as long, and was the best school of philosophy, morality, and politics
that then existed in the province; for our queries, which were
read the week preceding their discussion, put us upon reading with
attention upon the several subjects, that we might speak more to
the purpose; and here, too, we acquired better habits of conversation,
everything being studied in our rules which might prevent
our disgusting each other. From hence the long continuance of
the club, which I shall have frequent occasion to speak further of
hereafter.</p>

<p>But my giving this account of it here is to show something of
the interest I had, every one of these exerting themselves in
recommending business to us. Breintnal particularly procured
us from the Quakers the printing forty sheets of their history, the
rest being to be done by Keimer; and upon this we worked exceedingly
hard, for the price was low. It was a folio, pro patria
size, in pica, with long primer notes. I composed of it a sheet a
day, and Meredith worked it off at press; it was often eleven at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
night, and sometimes later, before I had finished my distribution
    <a name="FNanchor_95_96" id="FNanchor_95_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_96" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
for the next day's work, for the little jobs sent in by our other
friends now and then put us back. But so determined I was to
continue doing a sheet a day of the folio that one night, when,
having imposed<a name="FNanchor_96_97" id="FNanchor_96_97"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_96_97" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> my forms, I thought my day's work over, one
of them by accident was broken, and two pages reduced to pi,
    <a name="FNanchor_97_98" id="FNanchor_97_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_98" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
I immediately distributed and composed it over again before I
went to bed; and this industry, visible to our neighbors, began to
give us character and credit; particularly, I was told, that mention
being made of the new printing office at the merchants'
Every-Night Club, the general opinion was that it must fail, there
being already two printers in the place, Keimer and Bradford; but
Dr. Baird (whom you and I saw many years after at his native
place, St. Andrew's, in Scotland) gave a contrary opinion: "For
the industry of that Franklin," says he, "is superior to anything
I ever saw of the kind; I see him still at work when I go home
from club, and he is at work again before his neighbors are out
of bed." This struck the rest, and we soon after had offers from
one of them to supply us with stationery; but as yet we did not
choose to engage in shop business.</p>

<p>I mention this industry the more particularly and the more
freely, though it seems to be talking in my own praise, that those
of my posterity who shall read it may know the use of that virtue,
when they see its effects in my favor throughout this relation.</p>

<p>George Webb, who had found a female friend that lent him
wherewith to purchase his time of Keimer, now came to offer himself
as a journeyman to us. We could not then employ him; but
I foolishly let him know, as a secret, that I soon intended to begin
a newspaper, and might then have work for him. My hopes
of success, as I told him, were founded on this: that the then only
newspaper, printed by Bradford, was a paltry thing, wretchedly
managed, no way entertaining, and yet was profitable to him; I
therefore thought a good paper would scarcely fail of good encouragement.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
I requested Webb not to mention this; but he
told it to Keimer, who immediately, to be beforehand with me,
published proposals for printing one himself, on which Webb was
to be employed. I resented this; and, to counteract them, as
I could not yet begin our paper, I wrote several pieces of entertainment
for Bradford's paper, under the title of the "Busy
Body," which Breintnal continued some months. By this means
the attention of the public was fixed on that paper, and Keimer's
proposals, which were burlesqued and ridiculed, were disregarded.
He began his paper, however, and, after carrying it on three
quarters of a year, with at most only ninety subscribers, he offered
it to me for a trifle; and I, having been ready some time to go
on with it, took it in hand directly, and it proved in a few years
extremely profitable to me.<a name="FNanchor_98_99" id="FNanchor_98_99"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_98_99" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>I perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular number,
though our partnership still continued; the reason may be that,
in fact, the whole management of the business lay upon me.
Meredith was no compositor, a poor pressman, and seldom sober.
My friends lamented my connection with him, but I was to make
the best of it.</p>

<p>Our first papers made a quite different appearance from any
before in the province; a better type, and better printed; but
some spirited remarks of my writing, on the dispute
    <a name="FNanchor_99_100" id="FNanchor_99_100"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_99_100" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> then going
on between Governor Burnet and the Massachusetts Assembly,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
struck the principal people, occasioned the paper and the manager
of it to be much talked of, and in a few weeks brought them all
to be our subscribers.</p>

<p>Their example was followed by many, and our number went
on growing continually. This was one of the first good effects
of my having learned a little to scribble;<a name="FNanchor_N_9" id="FNanchor_N_9"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_9" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> another was that the
leading men, seeing a newspaper now in the hands of one who
could also handle a pen, thought it convenient to oblige and encourage
me. Bradford still printed the votes and laws and other
public business. He had printed an address of the House to the
governor in a coarse, blundering manner; we reprinted it elegantly
and correctly, and sent one to every member. They
were sensible of the difference; it strengthened the hands of our
friends in the House, and they voted us their printers for the year
ensuing.</p>

<p>Among my friends in the House I must not forget Mr. Hamilton,
before mentioned, who was then returned from England,
and had a seat in it. He interested himself for me strongly in
that instance, as he did in many others afterward, continuing his
patronage till his death.<a name="FNanchor_100_101" id="FNanchor_100_101"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_100_101" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt I owed
him, but did not press me. I wrote him an ingenuous letter of
acknowledgment, craved his forbearance a little longer, which
he allowed me, and as soon as I was able I paid the principle,
with interest, and many thanks; so that erratum was in some degree
corrected.</p>

<p>But now another difficulty came upon me which I had never
the least reason to expect. Mr. Meredith's father, who was to
have paid for our printing house, according to the expectations
given me, was able to advance only one hundred pounds currency,
which had been paid; and a hundred more was due to the
merchant, who grew impatient, and sued us all. We gave bail,
but saw that, if the money could not be raised in time, the suit
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
must soon come to a judgment and execution, and our hopeful
prospects must, with us, be ruined, as the press and letters must
be sold for payment, perhaps at half price.</p>

<p>In this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have never
forgotten, nor ever shall forget while I can remember anything,
came to me separately, unknown to each other, and, without any
application from me, offering each of them to advance me all the
money that should be necessary to enable me to take the whole
business upon myself, if that should be practicable; but they did
not like my continuing the partnership with Meredith, who, as
they said, was often seen drunk in the streets, and playing at low
games in alehouses, much to our discredit. These two friends
were William Coleman and Robert Grace. I told them I could
not propose a separation while any prospect remained of the
Merediths' fulfilling their part of our agreement, because I thought
myself under great obligations to them for what they had done
and would do if they could; but, if they finally failed in their
performance, and our partnership must be dissolved, I should
then think myself at liberty to accept the assistance of my
friends.</p>

<p>Thus the matter rested for some time, when I said to my partner,
"Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have
undertaken in this affair of ours, and is unwilling to advance for
you and me what he would for you alone. If that is the case,
tell me, and I will resign the whole to you, and go about my business."
"No," said he, "my father has really been disappointed,
and is really unable; and I am unwilling to distress him further.
I see this is a business I am not fit for. I was bred a farmer, and
it was a folly in me to come to town, and put myself, at thirty
years of age, an apprentice to learn a new trade. Many of our
Welsh people are going to settle in North Carolina, where land is
cheap. I am inclined to go with them, and follow my old employment.
You may find friends to assist you. If you will take
the debts of the company upon you, return to my father the hundred
pounds he has advanced, pay my little personal debts, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
give me thirty pounds and a new saddle, I will relinquish the
partnership, and leave the whole in your hands." I agreed to
this proposal; it was drawn up in writing, signed, and sealed immediately.
I gave him what he demanded, and he went soon
after to Carolina, from whence he sent me next year two long
letters, containing the best account that had been given of that
country, the climate, the soil, husbandry, etc., for in those matters
he was very judicious. I printed them in the papers, and
they gave great satisfaction to the public.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone, I recurred to my two friends; and
because I would not give an unkind preference to either, I took
half of what each had offered and I wanted of one, and half of
the other, paid off the company's debts, and went on with the
business in my own name, advertising that the partnership was
dissolved. I think this was in or about the year 1729.</p>

<p>About this time there was a cry among the people for more
paper money, only fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the
province, and that soon to be sunk. The wealthy inhabitants
opposed any addition, being against all paper currency, from an
apprehension that it would depreciate, as it had done in New
England, to the prejudice of all creditors. We had discussed
this point in our Junto, where I was on the side of an addition,
being persuaded that the first small sum struck in 1723 had done
much good by increasing the trade, employment, and number of
inhabitants in the province, since I now saw all the old houses
inhabited and many new ones building; whereas, I remembered
well that when I first walked about the streets of Philadelphia,
eating my roll, I saw most of the houses in Walnut Street, between
Second and Front Streets, with bills on their doors, "To
be Let;" and many likewise in Chestnut Street and other streets,
which made me then think the inhabitants of the city were deserting
it one after another.</p>

<p>Our debates possessed me so fully of the subject that I wrote
and printed an anonymous pamphlet on it, entitled, "The Nature
and Necessity of a Paper Currency." It was well received by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the common people in general; but the rich men disliked it, for
it increased and strengthened the clamor for more money, and
they, happening to have no writers among them that were able to
answer it, their opposition slackened, and the point was carried
by a majority in the House. My friends there, who conceived I
had been of some service, thought fit to reward me by employing
me in printing the money,&mdash;a very profitable job and a great help
to me. This was another advantage gained by my being able to
write.</p>

<p>The utility of this currency became by time and experience so
evident as never afterward to be much disputed; so that it grew
soon to fifty-five thousand pounds, and in 1739 to eighty thousand
pounds, since which it rose during war to upward of three hundred
and fifty thousand pounds, trade, building, and inhabitants
all the while increasing, though I now think there are limits, beyond
which the quantity may be hurtful.<a name="FNanchor_101_102" id="FNanchor_101_102"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_101_102" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>I soon after obtained, through my friend Hamilton, the printing
of the Newcastle paper money, another profitable job, as I
then thought it, small things appearing great to those in small
circumstances; and these, to me, were really great advantages, as
they were great encouragements. He procured for me, also, the
printing of the laws and votes of that government,
    <a name="FNanchor_102_103" id="FNanchor_102_103"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_102_103" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> which continued
in my hands as long as I followed the business.</p>

<p>I now opened a little stationer's shop. I had in it blanks of all
sorts, the correctest that ever appeared among us, being assisted
in that by my friend Breintnal. I had also paper, parchment,
chapmen's books, etc. One Whitemash, a compositor I had
known in London, an excellent workman, now came to me, and
worked with me constantly and diligently; and I took an apprentice,
the son of Aquila Rose.</p>

<p>I began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for the
printing house. In order to secure my credit and character as a
tradesman, I took care not only to be in reality industrious and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
frugal, but to avoid all appearances to the contrary. I dressed
plainly; I was seen at no places of idle diversion; I never went
out a-fishing or shooting; a book, indeed, sometimes debauched
me from my work, but that was seldom, snug,<a name="FNanchor_103_104" id="FNanchor_103_104"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_103_104" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and gave no scandal;
and, to show that I was not above my business, I sometimes
brought home the paper I purchased at the stores through the
streets on a wheelbarrow. Thus, being esteemed an industrious,
thriving young man, and paying duly for what I bought, the
merchants who imported stationery solicited my custom; others
proposed supplying me with books, and I went on swimmingly.
In the mean time, Keimer's credit and business declining daily,
he was at last forced to sell his printing house to satisfy his creditors.
He went to Barbadoes, and there lived some years in very
poor circumstances.</p>

<p>His apprentice, David Harry, whom I had instructed while I
worked with him, set up in his place at Philadelphia, having
bought his materials. I was at first apprehensive of a powerful
rival in Harry, as his friends were very able and had a good deal
of interest. I therefore proposed a partnership to him, which he,
fortunately for me, rejected with scorn. He was very proud,
dressed like a gentleman, lived expensively, took much diversion
and pleasure abroad, ran in debt, and neglected his business;
upon which, all business left him; and, finding nothing to do, he
followed Keimer to Barbadoes, taking the printing house with
him. There this apprentice employed his former master as a
journeyman; they quarreled often; Harry went continually behindhand,
and at length was forced to sell his types and return
to his country work in Pennsylvania. The person that bought
them employed Keimer to use them, but in a few years he died.</p>

<p>There remained now no competitor with me at Philadelphia
but the old one, Bradford, who was rich and easy, did a little
printing now and then by straggling hands, but was not very
anxious about the business. However, as he kept the post office,
it was imagined he had better opportunities of obtaining news.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
His paper was thought a better distributer of advertisements than
mine, and therefore had many more, which was a profitable thing
to him, and a disadvantage to me; for, though I did indeed receive
and send papers by post, yet the public opinion was otherwise,
for what I did send was by bribing the riders,<a name="FNanchor_104_105" id="FNanchor_104_105"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_104_105" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> who took
them privately, Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it, which
occasioned some resentment on my part; and I thought so
meanly of him for it that, when I afterward came into his situation,
I took care never to imitate it.</p>

<p>I had hitherto continued to board with Godfrey, who lived in
part of my house with his wife and children, and had one side of
the shop for his glazier's business, though he worked little, being
always absorbed in his mathematics. Mrs. Godfrey projected a
match for me with a relation's daughter, and took opportunities
of bringing us often together, till a serious courtship on my part
ensued, the girl being in herself very deserving. The old folks
encouraged me by continual invitations to supper, and by leaving
us together, till at length it was time to explain. Mrs. Godfrey
managed our little treaty. I let her know that I expected as
much money<a name="FNanchor_N_10" id="FNanchor_N_10"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_10" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> with their daughter as would pay off my remaining
debt for the printing house, which I believe was then above a
hundred pounds. She brought me word they had no such sum to
spare. I said they might mortgage their house in the loan office.
The answer to this, after some days, was that they did not approve
the match; that, on inquiry of Bradford, they had been
informed the printing business was not a profitable one; the types
would soon be worn out and more wanted; that S. Keimer and
D. Harry had failed one after the other, and I should probably
soon follow them; and therefore I was forbidden the house, and
the daughter shut up.</p>

<p>Whether this was a real change of sentiment, or only artifice,
on a supposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract,
and therefore that we should steal a marriage, which would
leave them at liberty to give or withhold what they pleased, I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
know not; but I suspected the latter, resented it, and went no
more. Mrs. Godfrey brought me afterward some more favorable
accounts of their disposition, and would have drawn me on
again; but I declared absolutely my resolution to have nothing
more to do with that family. This was resented by the Godfreys;
we differed, and they removed, leaving me the whole house,
and I resolved to take no more inmates.</p>

<p>But this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I looked
round me and made overtures of acquaintance in other places;
but soon found that, the business of a printer being generally
thought a poor one, I was not to expect money with a wife, unless
with such a one as I should not otherwise think agreeable.
In the mean time a friendly correspondence as neighbors and old
acquaintances had continued between me and Mr. Read's family,
who all had a regard for me from the time of my first lodging
in their house. I was often invited there and consulted in their
affairs, wherein I sometimes was of service. I pitied poor Miss
Read's unfortunate situation, who was generally dejected, seldom
cheerful, and avoided company. I considered my giddiness and
inconstancy when in London as in a great degree the cause of
her unhappiness, though the mother was good enough to think
the fault more her own than mine, as she had prevented our
marrying before I went thither, and persuaded the other match in
my absence. Our mutual affection was revived, but there were
now great objections to our union. The match<a name="FNanchor_105_106" id="FNanchor_105_106"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_105_106" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> was indeed looked
upon as invalid, a preceding wife being said to be living in England;
but this could not easily be proved because of the distance;
and though there was a report of his death, it was not certain.
Then, though it should be true, he had left many debts, which his
successor might be called upon to pay. We ventured, however,
over all these difficulties, and I took her to wife Sept. 1, 1730.
None of the inconveniences happened that we had apprehended;
she proved a good and faithful helpmate, assisted me much by
attending shop, we throve together, and have ever mutually endeavored
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to make each other happy. Thus I corrected that
great erratum as well as I could.<a name="FNanchor_106_107" id="FNanchor_106_107"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_106_107" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>About this time, our club meeting not at a tavern but in a
little room of Mr. Grace's set apart for that purpose, a proposition
was made by me that, since our books were often referred
to in our disquisitions upon the queries, it might be convenient
to us to have them all together where we met, that upon occasion
they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books
to a common library, we should, while we liked to keep them together,
have each of us the advantage of using the books of all
the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each
owned the whole. It was liked and agreed to, and we filled one
end of the room with such books as we could best spare. The
number was not so great as we expected; and though they had
been of great use, yet, some inconveniences occurring for want
of due care of them, the collection, after about a year, was separated,
and each took his books home again.</p>

<p>And now I set on foot my first project of a public nature,&mdash;that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
for a subscription library.<a name="FNanchor_N_11" id="FNanchor_N_11"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_11" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> I drew up the proposals, got them
put into form by our great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help
of my friends in the Junto, procured fifty subscribers of forty
shillings each to begin with, and ten shillings a year for fifty
years, the term our company was to continue. We afterward
obtained a charter, the company being increased to one hundred.
This was the mother of all the North American subscription
libraries, now so numerous. It is become a great thing
itself, and continually increasing. These libraries have improved
the general conversation of the Americans, made the common
tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from
other countries, and perhaps have contributed in some degree to
the stand so generally made throughout the colonies in defense
of their privileges.<a name="FNanchor_107_108" id="FNanchor_107_108"></a>

<hr class="hr2" />
<h3><span class="smcap">Continuation of the Account of my Life, Begun at<br />
Passy, near Paris, 1784.</span></h3>

<p>It is some time since I received the above letters,
    <a name="FNanchor_108_109" id="FNanchor_108_109"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_108_109" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> but I have
been too busy till now to think of complying with the request
they contain. It might, too, be much better done if I were at
home among my papers, which would aid my memory, and help
to ascertain dates; but my return being uncertain, and having
just now a little leisure, I will endeavor to recollect and write
what I can; if I live to get home, it may there be corrected and
improved.</p>

<p>Not having any copy here of what is already written, I know
not whether an account is given of the means I used to establish
the Philadelphia Public Library, which, from a small beginning,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
is now become so considerable, though I remember to have come
down to near the time of that transaction (1730). I will therefore
begin here with an account of it, which may be struck out
if found to have been already given.</p>

<p>At the time I established myself in Pennsylvania there was not
a good bookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward
of Boston. In New York and Philadelphia the printers were
indeed stationers; they sold only paper, etc., almanacs, ballads,
and a few common schoolbooks. Those who loved reading were
obliged to send for their books from England; the members of
the Junto had each a few. We had left the alehouse where
we first met, and hired a room to hold our club in. I proposed
that we should all of us bring our books to that room, where
they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences, but
become a common benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrow
such as he wished to read at home. This was accordingly done,
and for some time contented us.</p>

<p>Finding the advantage of this little collection, I proposed to
render the benefit from books more common by commencing a
public subscription library. I drew a sketch of the plan and
rules that would be necessary, and got a skillful conveyancer,
Mr. Charles Brockden, to put the whole in form of articles of
agreement to be subscribed, by which each subscriber engaged to
pay a certain sum down for the first purchase of books, and an
annual contribution for increasing them. So few were the readers
at that time in Philadelphia, and the majority of us so poor,
that I was not able, with great industry, to find more than fifty
persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay down for this
purpose forty shillings each and ten shillings per annum.</p>

<p>On this little fund we began. The books were imported; the
library was opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers,
on their promissory notes to pay double the value if not
duly returned. The institution soon manifested its utility, was
imitated by other towns and in other provinces. The libraries
were augmented by donations; reading became fashionable; and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
our people, having no public amusements to divert their attention
from study, became better acquainted with books, and in a
few years were observed by strangers to be better instructed and
more intelligent than people of the same rank generally are in
other countries.</p>

<p>When we were about to sign the above-mentioned articles,
which were to be binding on us, our heirs, etc., for fifty years,
Mr. Brockden, the scrivener, said to us: "You are young men,
but it is scarcely probable that any of you will live to see the expiration
of the term fixed in the instrument." A number of us,
however, are yet living; but the instrument was, after a few years,
rendered null by a charter that incorporated and gave perpetuity
to the company.<a name="FNanchor_109_110" id="FNanchor_109_110"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_109_110" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the
subscriptions made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting
one's self as the proposer of any useful project that might be
supposed to raise one's reputation in the smallest degree above
that of one's neighbors, when one has need of their assistance to
accomplish that project. I therefore put myself as much as I
could out of sight, and stated it as a scheme of a "number of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
friends," who had requested me to go about and propose it to such
as they thought lovers of reading. In this way my affair went
on more smoothly, and I ever after practiced it on such occasions,
and, from my frequent successes, can heartily recommend
it. The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterward be
amply repaid. If it remains awhile uncertain to whom the merit
belongs, some one more vain than yourself will be encouraged
to claim it, and then even envy will be disposed to do you justice
by plucking those assumed feathers, and restoring them to their
right owner.</p>

<p>This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant
study, for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and
thus repaired in some degree the loss of the learned education
my father once intended for me. Reading was the only amusement
I allowed myself. I spent no time in taverns, games, or
frolics of any kind; and my industry in my business continued
as indefatigable as it was necessary. I was indebted for my
printing house; I had a young family coming on to be educated,
and I had to contend for business with two printers, who were
established in the place before me. My circumstances, however,
grew daily easier. My original habits of frugality continuing, and
my father having, among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently
repeated a proverb of Solomon, "Seest thou a man diligent
in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before
mean men,"<a name="FNanchor_110_111" id="FNanchor_110_111"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_110_111" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> I from thence considered industry as a means
of obtaining wealth and distinction, which encouraged me, though
I did not think that I should ever literally "stand before kings;"
which, however, has since happened, for I have stood before five,
and even had the honor of sitting down with one (the King of
Denmark) to dinner.<a name="FNanchor_N_12" id="FNanchor_N_12"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_12" class="fnanchor">[n]</a></p>

<p>We have an English proverb that says, "He that would thrive
must ask his wife." It was lucky for me that I had one as much
disposed to industry and frugality as myself. She assisted me
cheerfully in my business, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
shop, purchasing old linen rags for the paper makers, etc.
We kept no idle servants, our table was plain and simple, our
furniture of the cheapest. For instance, my breakfast was a
long time bread and milk (no tea), and I ate it out of a two-penny
earthen porringer, with a pewter spoon. But mark how
luxury will enter families and make a progress in spite of principle.
Being called one morning to breakfast, I found it in a china
bowl with a spoon of silver! They had been bought for me without
my knowledge by my wife, and had cost her the enormous
sum of three-and-twenty shillings, for which she had no other excuse
or apology to make but that she thought her husband deserved
a silver spoon and china bowl as well as any of his neighbors.
This was the first appearance of plate and china in our
house, which afterward, in a course of years, as our wealth increased,
augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in
value.</p>

<p>I had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and, though
I early absented myself from the public assemblies of the sect,
Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious
principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence
of the Deity; that he made the world, and governed it by his
providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the
doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all
crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter.
These I esteemed the essentials of every religion; and
being to be found in all the religions we had in our country, I
respected them all, though with different degrees of respect as
I found them more or less mixed with other articles which, without
any tendency to inspire, promote, or confirm morality, served
principally to divide us, and make us unfriendly to one another.
This respect to all, with an opinion that the worst had some good
effects, induced me to avoid all discourse that might tend to
lessen the good opinion another might have of his own religion;
and as our province increased in people, and new places of worship
were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
contribution, my mite for such purpose, whatever might be the
sect, was never refused.</p>

<p>Though I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an
opinion of its propriety and of its utility when rightly conducted,
and I regularly paid my annual subscription for the support of
the only Presbyterian minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia.
He used to visit me sometimes as a friend, and admonish
me to attend his administrations, and I was now and then prevailed
on to do so, once for five Sundays successively. Had he
been in my opinion a good preacher, perhaps I might have continued,
notwithstanding the occasion I had for the Sunday's leisure
in my course of study; but his discourses were chiefly either
polemic arguments or explications of the peculiar doctrines of
our sect, and were all to me very dry, uninteresting, and unedifying,
since not a single moral principle was inculcated or enforced,
their aim seeming to be rather to make us Presbyterians than
good citizens.</p>

<p>At length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter
of Philippians: "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true,
whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be
any praise, think on these things;" and I imagined, in a sermon
on such a text, we could not miss of having some morality.
But he confined himself to five points only, as meant by the
apostle: 1. Keeping holy the Sabbath day. 2. Being diligent in
reading the holy Scriptures. 3. Attending duly the public worship.
4. Partaking of the sacrament. 5. Paying a due respect
to God's ministers. These might be all good things; but, as they
were not the kind of good things that I expected from that text,
I despaired of ever meeting with them from any other, was disgusted,
and attended his preaching no more. I had some years
before composed a little liturgy, or form of prayer, for my own
private use (in 1728), entitled "Articles of Belief and Acts of
Religion." I returned to the use of this, and went no more to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the public assemblies. My conduct might be blamable, but I
leave it without attempting further to excuse it, my present purpose
being to relate facts, and not to make apologies for them.</p>

<h2>§ 5. CONTINUED SELF-EDUCATION.</h2>

<p>It was about this time I conceived the bold and arduous project
of arriving at moral perfection. I wished to live without
committing any fault at any time; I would conquer all that
either natural inclination, custom, or company might lead me
into. As I knew, or thought I knew, what was right and wrong,
I did not see why I might not always do the one and avoid the
other. But I soon found I had undertaken a task of more difficulty
than I had imagined. While my care was employed in
guarding against one fault, I was often surprised by another;
habit took the advantage of inattention; inclination was sometimes
too strong for reason. I concluded at length that the
mere speculative conviction that it was our interest to be completely
virtuous was not sufficient to prevent our slipping; and
that the contrary habits must be broken, and good ones acquired
and established, before we can have any dependence on a steady,
uniform rectitude of conduct. For this purpose I therefore contrived
the following method.</p>

<p>In the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had met
with in my reading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous,
as different writers included more or fewer ideas under the
same name. Temperance, for example, was by some confined
to eating and drinking, while by others it was extended to mean
the moderating every other pleasure, appetite, inclination, or
passion, bodily or mental, even to our avarice and ambition. I
proposed to myself, for the sake of clearness, to use rather more
names, with fewer ideas annexed to each, than a few names with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
more ideas; and I included under thirteen names of virtues all
that at that time occurred to me as necessary or desirable, and
annexed to each a short precept, which fully expressed the extent
I gave to its meaning.</p>

<p>These names of virtues, with their precepts, were:</p>

<p class="center section">1. <span class="smcap">Temperance.</span></p>

<p>Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.</p>

<p class="center section">2. <span class="smcap">Silence.</span></p>

<p>Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling
conversation.</p>

<p class="center section">3. <span class="smcap">Order.</span></p>

<p>Let all your things have their places; let each part of your
business have its time.</p>

<p class="center section">4. <span class="smcap">Resolution.</span></p>

<p>Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail
what you resolve.</p>

<p class="center section">5. <span class="smcap">Frugality.</span></p>

<p>Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e.,
waste nothing.</p>

<p class="center section">6. <span class="smcap">Industry.</span></p>

<p>Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut
off all unnecessary actions.</p>

<p class="center section">7. <span class="smcap">Sincerity.</span></p>

<p>Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly; and, if you
speak, speak accordingly.</p>

<p class="center section">8. <span class="smcap">Justice.</span></p>

<p>Wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are
your duty.</p>

<p class="center section">9. <span class="smcap">Moderation.</span></p>

<p>Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you
think they deserve.</p>

<p class="center section"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
    10. <span class="smcap">Cleanliness.</span></p>

<p>Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation.</p>

<p class="center section">11. <span class="smcap">Tranquillity.</span></p>

<p>Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.</p>

<p class="center section">12. <span class="smcap">Chastity.</span></p>

<p class="center section">13. <span class="smcap">Humility.</span></p>

<p>Imitate Jesus and Socrates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues,
I judged it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting
the whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and,
when I should be master of that, then to proceed to another,
and so on, till I should have gone through the thirteen; and, as
the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition
of certain others, I arranged them with that view as they stand
above. Temperance first, as it tends to procure that coolness and
clearness of head which is so necessary where constant vigilance
was to be kept up, and guard maintained against the unremitting
attraction of ancient habits and the force of perpetual temptations.
This being acquired and established, Silence would be
more easy; and my desire being to gain knowledge at the same
time that I improved in virtue, and considering that in conversation
it was obtained rather by the use of the ears than of the
tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I was getting into
of prattling, punning, and joking, which only made me acceptable
to trifling company, I gave Silence the second place. This
and the next, Order, I expected would allow me more time for
attending to my project and my studies. Resolution, once become
habitual, would keep me firm in my endeavors to obtain all
the subsequent virtues; Frugality and Industry, freeing me from
my remaining debt, and producing affluence and independence,
would make more easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice, etc.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Conceiving then that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras in
his "Golden Verses,"<a name="FNanchor_111_112" id="FNanchor_111_112"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_111_112" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> daily examination would be necessary, I
contrived the following method for conducting that examination.</p>

<p>I made a little book,<a name="FNanchor_112_113" id="FNanchor_112_113"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_112_113" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> in which I allotted a page for each of
the virtues. I ruled each page with red ink, so as to have seven
columns, one for each day of the week, marking each column
with a letter for the day. I crossed these columns with thirteen
red lines, marking the beginning of each line with the first letter
of one of the virtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I
might mark, by a little black spot, every fault I found upon examination
to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day.</p>

<p>I determined to give a week's strict attention to each of the
virtues successively. Thus, in the first week my great guard was
to avoid every (the least) offense against Temperance, leaving the
other virtues to their ordinary chance, only marking every evening
the faults of the day. Thus, if in the first week I could keep
my first line, marked T., clear of spots, I supposed the habit of
that virtue so much strengthened, and its opposite weakened, that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
I might venture extending my attention to include the next, and
for the following week keep both lines clear of spots. Proceeding
thus to the last, I could go through a course complete in thirteen
weeks, and four courses in a year. And, like him who, having
a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the bad</p>

<p>herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and his strength, but
works on one of the beds at a time, and, having accomplished
the first, proceeds to a second, so I should have, I hoped, the
encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress I made
in virtue, by clearing successively my lines of their spots, till in
the end, by a number of courses, I should be happy in viewing a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
clean book, after a thirteen-weeks' daily examination. My little
book had for its motto these lines from Addison's "Cato:"</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here will I hold. If there's a power above us<br /></span>
<span class="i00">(And that there is, all Nature cries aloud<br /></span>
<span class="i00">Thro' all her works), He must delight in virtue;<br /></span>
<span class="i00">And that which He delights in must be happy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another from Cicero:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"O vitæ Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix expultrixque
vitiorum! Unus dies, bene et ex præceptis tuis actus, peccanti immortalitati
est anteponendus."<a name="FNanchor_113_114" id="FNanchor_113_114"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_113_114" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Another from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of wisdom or
virtue:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches
and honor. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are
peace." (iii. 16, 17.)</p>
</div>

<p>And, conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I thought
it right and necessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it. To
this end I formed the following little prayer, which was prefixed
to my tables of examination, for daily use:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! merciful Guide! Increase
in me that wisdom which discovers my truest interest. Strengthen
my resolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates. Accept my
kind offices to thy other children as the only return in my power for
thy continual favors to me."</p>
</div>

<p>I used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomson's
Poems:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme!<br /></span>
<span class="i00">O teach me what is good; teach me Thyself!<br /></span>
<span class="i00">Save me from folly, vanity, and vice,<br /></span>
<span class="i00">From every low pursuit; and fill my soul<br /></span>
<span class="i00">With knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure;<br /></span>
<span class="i00">Sacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!"<br /></span>

<p>I entered upon the execution of this plan for self-examination,
and continued it, with occasional intermissions, for some time. I
was surprised to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had
imagined; but I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish.
To avoid the trouble of renewing now and then my little book,
which, by scraping out the marks on the paper of old faults to
make room for new ones in a new course, became full of holes, I
transferred my tables and precepts to the ivory leaves of a memorandum
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
book, on which the lines were drawn with red ink, that
made a durable stain, and on those lines I marked my faults with
a black lead pencil, which marks I could easily wipe out with a
wet sponge. After a while I went through one course only in a
year, and afterward only one in several years, till at length I
omitted them entirely, being employed in voyages and business
abroad, with a multiplicity of affairs that interfered; but I always
carried my little book with me.</p>

<p>My scheme of Order gave me the most trouble; and I found
that, though it might be practicable where a man's business was
such as to leave him the disposition of his time,&mdash;that of a journeyman
printer, for instance,&mdash;it was not possible to be exactly
observed by a master, who must mix with the world, and often
receive people of business at their own hours. Order, too, with
regard to places for things, papers, etc., I found extremely difficult
to acquire. I had not been early accustomed to it, and, having
an exceeding good memory, I was not so sensible of the inconvenience
attending want of method. This article, therefore,
cost me so much painful attention, and my faults in it vexed me
so much, and I made so little progress in amendment and had
such frequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give up the attempt,
and content myself with a faulty character in that respect,
like the man who, in buying an ax of a smith, my neighbor, desired
to have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge. The
smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the
wheel. He turned, while the smith pressed the broad face of the
ax hard and heavily on the stone, which made the turning of it
very fatiguing. The man came every now and then from the
wheel to see how the work went on, and at length would take
his ax as it was, without farther grinding. "No," said the smith,
"turn on, turn on; we shall have it bright by and by; as yet, it
is only speckled." "Yes," says the man, "but I think I like a
speckled ax best." And I believe this may have been the case
with many, who, having, for want of some such means as I employed,
found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
habits in other points of vice and virtue, have given up the struggle,
and concluded that a "speckled ax" was best. For something,
that pretended to be reason, was every now and then suggesting
to me that such extreme nicety as I exacted of myself might be a
kind of foppery in morals, which, if it were known, would make
me ridiculous; that a perfect character might be attended with
the inconvenience of being envied and hated; and that a benevolent
man should allow a few faults in himself, to keep his friends
in countenance.</p>

<p>In truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to order;
and, now I am grown old and my memory bad, I feel very sensibly
the want of it. But on the whole, though I never arrived
at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell
far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavor, a better and a happier
man than I otherwise should have been if I had not attempted
it; as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved
copies, though they never reach the wished-for excellence of
those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavor, and is tolerable
while it continues fair and legible.</p>

<p>It may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little
artifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor owed the constant
felicity of his life, down to his seventy-ninth year, in which this is
written. What reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand
of Providence; but, if they arrive, the reflection on past happiness
enjoyed ought to help his bearing them with more resignation.
To temperance he ascribes his long-continued health, and what is
still left to him of a good constitution; to industry and frugality,
the early easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune,
with all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful citizen,
and obtained for him some degree of reputation among the
learned; to sincerity and justice, the confidence of his country,
and the honorable employs it conferred upon him; and to the
joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues, even in the imperfect
state he was able to acquire them, all that evenness of temper
and that cheerfulness in conversation which makes his company
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
still sought for, and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance.
I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the
example and reap the benefit.</p>

<p>It will be remarked that, though my scheme was not wholly
without religion, there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing
tenets of any particular sect. I had purposely avoided
them; for, being fully persuaded of the utility and excellency of
my method, and that it might be serviceable to people in all religions,
and intending some time or other to publish it, I would
not have anything in it that should prejudice any one, of any
sect, against it. I purposed writing a little comment on each virtue,
in which I would have shown the advantages of possessing
it, and the mischiefs attending its opposite vice; and I should
have called my book "The Art of Virtue,"<a name="FNanchor_114_115" id="FNanchor_114_115"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_114_115" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> because it would
have shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue, which
would have distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be
good, that does not instruct and indicate the means, but is like
the apostle's man of verbal charity, who only, without showing
to the naked and hungry how or where they might get clothes or
victuals, exhorted them to be fed and clothed. (James ii. 15, 16.)</p>

<p>But it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing
this comment was never fulfilled. I did, indeed, from time to
time, put down short hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to
be made use of in it, some of which I have still by me; but the
necessary close attention to private business in the earlier part of
my life, and public business since, has occasioned my postponing
it; for, it being connected in my mind with a great and extensive
project, that required the whole man to execute, and which
an unforeseen succession of employs prevented my attending to,
it has hitherto remained unfinished.</p>

<p>In this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine,
that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden,
but forbidden because they are hurtful, the nature of man
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
alone considered; that it was, therefore, every one's interest to
be virtuous who wished to be happy even in this world; and I
should, from this circumstance, (there being always in the world a
number of rich merchants, nobility, states, and princes, who have
need of honest instruments for the management of their affairs,
and such being so rare,) have endeavored to convince young persons
that no qualities were so likely to make a poor man's fortune
as those of probity and integrity.</p>

<p>My list of virtues contained at first but twelve; but a Quaker
friend having kindly informed me that I was generally thought
proud; that my pride showed itself frequently in conversation;
that I was not content with being in the right when discussing
any point, but was overbearing and rather insolent, of which he
convinced me by mentioning several instances,&mdash;I determined
endeavoring to cure myself, if I could, of this vice or folly among
the rest, and I added Humility to my list, giving an extensive meaning
to the word.</p>

<p>I cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this
virtue, but I had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it.
I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments
of others, and all positive assertion of my own. I even forbade
myself, agreeably to the old laws of our Junto, the use of every
word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion,
such as "certainly," "undoubtedly," etc., and I adopted, instead of
them, "I conceive," "I apprehend," or "I imagine" a thing to be so
or so; or "it so appears to me at present." When another asserted
something that I thought an error, I denied myself the pleasure of
contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity
in his proposition; and in answering I began by observing
that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right,
but in the present case there "appeared" or "seemed" to me some
difference, etc. I soon found the advantage of this change in my
manner: the conversations I engaged in went on more pleasantly;
the modest way in which I proposed my opinions procured them
a readier reception and less contradiction; I had less mortification<br />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
when I was found to be in the wrong; and I more easily
prevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me
when I happened to be in the right.</p>

<p>And this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to
natural inclination, became at length so easy and so habitual to
me, that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard
a dogmatical expression escape me. And to this habit (after my
character of integrity) I think it principally owing that I had early
so much weight with my fellow-citizens when I proposed new institutions,
or alterations in the old, and so much influence in public
councils when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker,
never eloquent, subject to much hesitation in my choice of words,
hardly correct in language, and yet I generally carried my points.</p>

<p>In reality there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so
hard to subdue as pride. Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down,
stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and will
every now and then peep out and show itself. You will see it,
perhaps, often in this history; for, even if I could conceive that
I had completely overcome it, I should probably be proud of my
humility.<a name="FNanchor_115_116" id="FNanchor_115_116"></a>

</div>

<p>Having mentioned a great and extensive project which I had
conceived, it seems proper that some account should be here
given of that project and its object. Its first rise in my mind appears
in the following little paper, accidentally preserved:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Observations on my Reading History, in Library, May 19, 1731.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"That the great affairs of the world,&mdash;the wars, revolutions, etc.,&mdash;are
carried on and effected by parties.</p>

<p>"That the view of these parties is their present general interest, or
what they take to be such.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
    "That the different views of these different parties occasion all
confusion.</p>

<p>"That while a party is carrying on a general design, each man has
his particular private interest in view.</p>

<p>"That as soon as a party has gained its general point, each member
becomes intent upon his particular interest; which, thwarting
others, breaks that party into divisions, and occasions more confusion.</p>

<p>"That few in public affairs act from a mere view of the good of their
country, whatever they may pretend; and though their actings bring
real good to their country, yet men primarily consider that their own
and their country's interest is united, and do not act from a principle
of benevolence.</p>

<p>"That fewer still, in public affairs, act with a view to the good of
mankind.</p>

<p>"There seems to me at present to be great occasion for raising a
United Party for Virtue, by forming the virtuous and good men of all
nations into a regular body, to be governed by suitable good and wise
rules, which good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in
their obedience to than common people are to common laws.</p>

<p>"I at present think that whoever attempts this aright, and is well
qualified, cannot fail of pleasing God, and of meeting with success.</p>

<div class="signature">

</div></div>

<p>Revolving this project in my mind, as to be undertaken hereafter,
when my circumstances should afford me the necessary
leisure, I put down from time to time, on pieces of paper, such
thoughts as occurred to me respecting it. Most of these are lost;
but I find one purporting to be the substance of an intended
creed, containing, as I thought, the essentials of every known
religion, and being free of everything that might shock the professors
of any religion. It is expressed in these words:</p>

<p>"That there is one God, who made all things.</p>

<p>"That he governs the world by his providence.</p>

<p>"That he ought to be worshiped by adoration, prayer, and
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>"But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to
man.</p>

<p>"That the soul is immortal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
    "And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice,
either here or hereafter."</p>

<p>My ideas at that time were that the sect should be begun and
spread at first among young and single men only; that each
person to be initiated should not only declare his assent to such
creed, but should have exercised himself with the thirteen-weeks'
examination and practice of the virtues, as in the before-mentioned
model; that the existence of such a society should be kept
a secret till it was become considerable, to prevent solicitations
for the admission of improper persons, but that the members
should each of them search among his acquaintance for ingenuous,
well-disposed youths, to whom, with prudent caution, the
scheme should be gradually communicated; that the members
should engage to afford their advice, assistance, and support to
each other in promoting one another's interests, business, and
advancement in life; that, for distinction, we should be called
"The Society of the Free and Easy:" free, as being, by the general
practice and habit of the virtues, free from the dominion of
vice; and particularly, by the practice of industry and frugality,
free from debt, which exposes a man to confinement and a species
of slavery to his creditors.</p>

<p>This is as much as I can now recollect of the project, except
that I communicated it in part to two young men, who adopted
it with some enthusiasm; but my then narrow circumstances, and
the necessity I was under of sticking close to my business, occasioned
my postponing the further prosecution of it at that time;
and my multifarious occupations, public and private, induced me
to continue postponing, so that it has been omitted till I have no
longer strength or activity left sufficient for such an enterprise;
though I am still of opinion that it was a practicable scheme, and
might have been very useful, by forming a great number of good
citizens; and I was not discouraged by the seeming magnitude
of the undertaking, as I have always thought that one man of
tolerable abilities may work great changes, and accomplish great
affairs among mankind, if he first forms a good plan, and, cutting
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
off all amusements or other employments that would divert his
attention, makes the execution of that same plan his sole study
and business.</p>

<p>In 1732 I first published my Almanac,<a name="FNanchor_117_118" id="FNanchor_117_118"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_117_118" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> under the name of
"Richard Saunders;" it was continued by me about twenty-five
years, and commonly called "Poor Richard's Almanac." I endeavored
to make it both entertaining and useful, and it accordingly
came to be in such demand that I reaped considerable profit from
it, vending annually near ten thousand. And observing that it was
generally read, scarce any neighborhood in the province being
without it, I considered it as a proper vehicle for conveying instruction
among the common people, who bought scarcely any
other books. I therefore filled all the little spaces that occurred
between the remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial
sentences,<a name="FNanchor_118_119" id="FNanchor_118_119"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_118_119" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality as
the means of procuring wealth, and thereby securing virtue; it
being more difficult for a man in want to act always honestly, as
(to use here one of those proverbs) "it is hard for an empty sack
to stand upright."</p>

<p>These proverbs, which contained the wisdom of many ages and
nations, I assembled and formed into a connected discourse,
    <a name="FNanchor_119_120" id="FNanchor_119_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_120" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
prefixed to the Almanac of 1757 as the harangue of a wise old
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
man to the people attending an auction. The bringing all these
scattered counsels thus into a focus enabled them to make greater
impression. The piece, being universally approved, was copied
in all the newspapers of the Continent, reprinted in Britain on a
broadside,<a name="FNanchor_120_121" id="FNanchor_120_121"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_120_121" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> to
    be stuck up in houses, two translations were made of
it in French, and great numbers bought by the clergy and gentry
to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants.
In Pennsylvania, as it discouraged useless expense in foreign superfluities,
some thought it had its share of influence in producing
that growing plenty of money which was observable for several
years after its publication.</p>

<p>I considered my newspaper, also, as another means of communicating
instruction, and in that view frequently reprinted in
it extracts from the "Spectator," and other moral writers, and
sometimes published little pieces of my own, which had been first
composed for reading in our Junto. Of these are a Socratic dialogue,
tending to prove that, whatever might be his parts and
abilities, a vicious man could not properly be called a man of
sense; and a discourse on self-denial, showing that virtue is not
secure till its practice becomes a habitude, and is free from the
opposition of contrary inclinations. These may be found in the
papers about the beginning of 1735.</p>

<p>In the conduct of my newspaper, I carefully excluded all libeling
and personal abuse, which is of late years become so disgraceful
to our country. Whenever I was solicited to insert anything
of that kind, and the writers pleaded, as they generally did, the
liberty of the press, and that a newspaper was like a stagecoach,
in which any one who would pay had a right to a place, my answer
was that I would print the piece separately if desired, and
the author might have as many copies as he pleased to distribute
himself, but that I would not take upon me to spread his detraction;
and that, having contracted with my subscribers to furnish
them with what might be either useful or entertaining, I could
not fill their papers with private altercation, in which they had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
no concern, without doing them manifest injustice. Now many
of our printers make no scruple of gratifying the malice of individuals
by false accusations of the fairest characters among ourselves,
augmenting animosity even to the producing of duels; and
are, moreover, so indiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on
the government of neighboring states, and even on the conduct
of our best national allies, which may be attended with the most
pernicious consequences. These things I mention as a caution
to young printers, and that they may be encouraged not to pollute
their presses and disgrace their profession by such infamous practices,
but refuse steadily, as they may see by my example that
such a course of conduct will not, on the whole, be injurious to
their interests.</p>

<p>In 1733 I sent one of my journeymen to Charleston, South
Carolina, where a printer was wanting. I furnished him with a
press and letters, on an agreement of partnership by which I was
to receive one third of the profits of the business, paying one third
of the expense. He was a man of learning, and honest but
ignorant in matters of account; and, though he sometimes made
me remittances, I could get no account from him, nor any satisfactory
state of our partnership while he lived. On his decease
the business was continued by his widow, who, being born and
bred in Holland, where, as I have been informed, the knowledge
of accounts makes a part of female education,<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> she not only sent
me as clear a state<a name="FNanchor_121_122" id="FNanchor_121_122"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_121_122" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> as she could find of the transactions past,
but continued to account with the greatest regularity and exactness
every quarter afterward, and managed the business with such
success that she not only brought up reputably a family of children,
but, at the expiration of the term, was able to purchase of
me the printing house, and establish her son in it.</p>

<p>I mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that
branch of education for our young women, as likely to be of more
use to them and their children, in case of widowhood, than either
music or dancing, by preserving them from losses by imposition
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
of crafty men, and enabling them to continue, perhaps, a profitable
mercantile house, with established correspondence, till a son
is grown up fit to undertake and go on with it, to the lasting advantage
and enriching of the family.</p>

<p>About the year 1734 there arrived among us from Ireland a
young Presbyterian preacher, named Hemphill, who delivered
with a good voice, and apparently extempore, most excellent discourses,
which drew together considerable numbers of different
persuasions, who joined in admiring them. Among the rest I
became one of his constant hearers, his sermons pleasing me, as
they had little of the dogmatical kind, but inculcated strongly
the practice of virtue, or what in the religious style are called
"good works." Those, however, of our congregation who considered
themselves as orthodox Presbyterians, disapproved his doctrine,
and were joined by most of the old clergy, who arraigned
him of heterodoxy<a name="FNanchor_122_123" id="FNanchor_122_123"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_122_123" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> before the synod, in order to have him silenced.
I became his zealous partisan, and contributed all I could to raise
a party in his favor, and we combated for him awhile with some
hopes of success. There was much scribbling pro and con
    <a name="FNanchor_123_124" id="FNanchor_123_124"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_123_124" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> upon
the occasion; and finding that, though an elegant preacher, he
was but a poor writer, I lent him my pen and wrote for him two
or three pamphlets, and one piece in the "Gazette" of April,
1735. Those pamphlets, as is generally the case with controversial
writings, though eagerly read at the time, were soon out of
vogue, and I question whether a single copy of them now exists.</p>

<p>During the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly.
One of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon
that was much admired, thought he had somewhere read the sermon
before, or at least a part of it. On search, he found that
part quoted at length in one of the British Reviews, from a discourse
of Dr. Foster's. This detection gave many of our party
disgust, who accordingly abandoned his cause, and occasioned
our more speedy discomfiture in the synod. I stuck by him,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
however, as I rather approved his giving us good sermons composed
by others than bad ones of his own manufacture, though
the latter was the practice of our common teachers. He afterward
acknowledged to me that none of those he preached were
his own, adding that his memory was such as enabled him to retain
and repeat any sermon after one reading only. On our defeat,
he left us in search elsewhere of better fortune, and I quitted
the congregation, never joining it after, though I continued many
years my subscription for the support of its ministers.</p>

<p>I had begun in 1733 to study languages; I soon made myself
so much a master of the French as to be able to read the books
with ease. I then undertook the Italian. An acquaintance, who
was also learning it, used often to tempt me to play chess with
him. Finding this took up too much of the time I had to spare
for study, I at length refused to play any more, unless on this
condition: that the victor in every game should have a right to
impose a task, either in parts of the grammar to be got by heart,
or in translations, etc., which task the vanquished was to perform
on honor before our next meeting. As we played pretty equally,
we thus beat one another into that language. I afterward, with
a little painstaking, acquired as much of the Spanish as to read
their books also.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that I had only one year's instruction
in a Latin school, and that when very young, after which I
neglected that language entirely. But, when I had attained an
acquaintance with the French, Italian, and Spanish, I was surprised
to find, on looking over a Latin Testament, that I understood
so much more of that language than I had imagined, which
encouraged me to apply myself again to the study of it, and I met
with more success, as those preceding languages had greatly
smoothed my way.</p>

<p>From these circumstances, I have thought that there is some
inconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages.<a name="FNanchor_N_15" id="FNanchor_N_15"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_15" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> We
are told that it is proper to begin first with the Latin, and, having
acquired that, it will be more easy to attain those modern
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
languages which are derived from it; and yet we do not begin
with the Greek in order more easily to acquire the Latin. It is
true that, if you can clamber and get to the top of the staircase
without using the steps, you will more easily gain them in descending;
but certainly, if you begin with the lowest you will with
more ease ascend to the top; and I would therefore offer it to
the consideration of those who superintend the education of our
youth, whether,&mdash;since many of those who begin with the Latin
quit the same after spending some years without having made
any great proficiency, and what they have learned becomes almost
useless, so that their time has been lost,&mdash;it would not have been
better to have begun with the French, proceeding to the Italian,
etc.; for, though, after spending the same time, they should quit
the study of languages and never arrive at the Latin, they would,
however, have acquired another tongue or two, that, being in
modern use, might be serviceable to them in common life.</p>

<p>After ten years' absence from Boston, and having become easy
in my circumstances, I made a journey thither to visit my relations,
which I could not sooner well afford. In returning, I
called at Newport to see my brother, then settled there with his
printing house. Our former differences were forgotten, and our
meeting was very cordial and affectionate. He was fast declining
in his health, and requested of me that, in case of his death,
which he apprehended not far distant, I would take home his son,
then but ten years of age, and bring him up to the printing business.
This I accordingly performed, sending him a few years to
school before I took him into the office. His mother carried on
the business till he was grown up, when I assisted him with an
assortment of new types, those of his father being in a manner
worn out. Thus it was that I made my brother ample
amends for the service I had deprived him of by leaving him
so early.</p>

<p>In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by
the smallpox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly,
and still regret, that I had not given it to him by inoculation.
    <a name="FNanchor_124_125" id="FNanchor_124_125"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_124_125" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that
operation on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves
if a child died under it; my example showing that the
regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer
should be chosen.</p>

<p>Our club, the Junto, was found so useful, and afforded such
satisfaction to the members, that several were desirous of introducing
their friends, which could not well be done without exceeding
what we had settled as a convenient number, namely, twelve.
We had from the beginning made it a rule to keep our institution
a secret, which was pretty well observed. The intention was to
avoid applications of improper persons for admittance, some of
whom, perhaps, we might find it difficult to refuse. I was one of
those who were against any addition to our number, but, instead
of it, made in writing a proposal that every member separately
should endeavor to form a subordinate club, with the same rules
respecting queries, etc., and without informing them of the connection
with the Junto. The advantages proposed were the improvement
of so many more young citizens by the use of our institutions;
our better acquaintance with the general sentiments of
the inhabitants on any occasion, as the Junto member might propose
what queries we should desire, and was to report to the
Junto what passed in his separate club; the promotion of our
particular interests in business by more extensive recommendation;
and the increase of our influence in public affairs and our
power of doing good by spreading through the several clubs the
sentiments of the Junto.</p>

<p>The project was approved, and every member undertook to form
his club, but they did not all succeed. Five or six only were
completed, which were called by different names, as "The Vine,"
"The Union," "The Band," etc. They were useful to themselves,
and afforded us a good deal of amusement, information,
and instruction, besides answering, in some considerable degree,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
our views of influencing the public opinion on particular occasions,
of which I shall give some instances in course of time as they
happened.</p>

"We should have our parents and relations in high esteem, love and embrace
good men, raise ourselves above corporeal affections, everywhere stand

momentary life, embrace the lot which falls to us by divine judgment, delight
in a divine frame of spirit, convert our mind to what is most excellent, love
good discourses, not lie open to impostures, not be servilely affected in the
possession of virtue, advise before action to prevent repentance, free ourselves
from uncertain opinions, live with knowledge, and lastly, that we should
adapt our bodies and the things without to the exercise of virtue. These are

of the age could devise. They made them a diary, a receipt book, a
jest book, and a weather prophet, as well as a calendar book of dates. The
household was poor indeed which could not scrape up a twopence or a sixpence
for the annual copy. Once bought, it hung by the big chimney-piece,
or lay upon the clock shelf with the Bible and a theological tract or two. It
was read by the light that shone from the blazing logs of the fireplace or the
homemade tallow dip. Its recipes helped the mother in her dyeing or weaving

<h2>§ 6. ENTERS PUBLIC LIFE.</h2>

<p>My first promotion was my being chosen, in 1736, clerk of the
General Assembly. The choice was made that year without
opposition; but the year following, when I was again proposed, (the
choice, like that of the members, being annual,) a new member
made a long speech against me, in order to favor some other
candidate. I was, however, chosen, which was the more agreeable
to me as, besides the pay for the immediate service as clerk,
the place gave me a better opportunity of keeping up an interest
among the members, which secured to me the business of printing
the votes, laws, paper money, and other occasional jobs for
the public, that, on the whole, were very profitable.</p>

<p>I therefore did not like the opposition of this new member, who
was a gentleman of fortune and education, with talents that were
likely to give him, in time, great influence in the House; which,
indeed, afterward happened. I did not, however, aim at gaining
his favor by paying any servile respect to him, but, after some
time, took this other method. Having heard that he had in his
library a certain very scarce and curious book, I wrote a note to
him, expressing my desire of perusing that book, and requesting
he would do me the favor of lending it to me for a few days.
He sent it immediately, and I returned it in about a week with another
note, expressing strongly my sense of the favor. When we
next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had never done
before), and with great civility; and he ever after manifested a
readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became great
friends, and our friendship continued to his death. This is another
instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
says: "He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready
to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged." And
it shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove, than
to resent, return, and continue, inimical proceedings.</p>

<p>In 1737, Colonel Spotswood, late governor of Virginia, and
then postmaster-general, being dissatisfied with the conduct of his
deputy at Philadelphia respecting some negligence in rendering
and inexactitude of his accounts, took from him the commission
and offered it to me. I accepted it readily, and found it of great
advantage; for, though the salary was small, it facilitated the correspondence
that improved my newspaper and increased the number
demanded, as well as the advertisements to be inserted, so that it
came to afford me a considerable income. My old competitor's
newspaper declined proportionably, and I was satisfied without
retaliating his refusal, while postmaster, to permit my papers being
carried by the riders. Thus he suffered greatly from his neglect
in due accounting; and I mention it as a lesson to those young
men who may be employed in managing affairs for others, that
they should always render accounts and make remittances with
great clearness and punctuality. The character of observing such
a conduct is the most powerful of all recommendations to new
employments and increase of business.</p>

<p>I began now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs, beginning,
however, with small matters. The city watch was one
of the first things that I conceived to want regulation. It was
managed by the constables of the respective wards in turn. The
constable warned a number of housekeepers to attend him for the
night. Those who chose never to attend, paid him six shillings
a year to be excused, which was supposed to be for hiring substitutes,
but was, in reality, much more than was necessary for that
purpose, and made the constableship a place of profit; and the
constable, for a little drink, often got such ragamuffins about him
as a watch that respectable housekeepers did not choose to mix
with them.<a name="FNanchor_N_17" id="FNanchor_N_17"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_17" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected, and
most of the nights spent in tippling. I thereupon wrote a paper to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
be read in Junto, representing these irregularities, but insisting
more particularly on the inequality of this six-shilling tax of the
constables respecting the circumstances of those who paid it, since
a poor widow housekeeper, all whose property to be guarded by
the watch did not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid
as much as the wealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds'
worth of goods in his stores.</p>

<p>On the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch the hiring
of proper men to serve constantly in that business; and as a more
equitable way of supporting the charge, the levying a tax that
should be proportioned to the property. This idea, being approved
by the Junto, was communicated to the other clubs, but
as arising in each of them; and though the plan was not immediately
carried into execution, yet, by preparing the minds of people
for the change, it paved the way for the law obtained a few
years after, when the members of our clubs were grown into more
influence.</p>

<p>About this time I wrote a paper, (first to be read in Junto, but
it was afterward published,) on the different accidents and carelessnesses
by which houses were set on fire, with cautions against
them, and means proposed of avoiding them. This was much
spoken of as a useful piece, and gave rise to a project which soon
followed it, of forming a company for the more ready extinguishing
of fires, and mutual assistance in removing and securing of
goods when in danger. Associates in this scheme were presently
found, amounting to thirty. Our articles of agreement obliged
every member to keep always in good order, and fit for use, a
certain number of leather buckets, with strong bags and baskets
(for packing and transporting of goods), which were to be brought
to every fire; and we agreed to meet once a month and spend a
social evening together, in discoursing and communicating such
ideas as occurred to us upon the subject of fires as might be useful
in our conduct on such occasions.</p>

<p>The utility of this institution soon appeared,<a name="FNanchor_N_18" id="FNanchor_N_18"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_18" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>] and many more
desiring to be admitted than we thought convenient for one company,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
they were advised to form another, which was accordingly
done; and this went on, one new company being formed after
another, till they became so numerous as to include most of the
inhabitants who were men of property; and now, at the time of
my writing this, though upward of fifty years since its establishment,
that which I first formed, called the "Union Fire Company,"
still subsists and flourishes, though the first members are all deceased
but myself and one who is older by a year than I am.
The small fines that have been paid by members for absence from
the monthly meetings have been applied to the purchase of fire
engines, ladders, fire hooks, and other useful implements for each
company, so that I question whether there is a city in the world
better provided with the means of putting a stop to beginning
conflagrations; and, in fact, since these institutions, the city has
never lost by fire more than one or two houses at a time, and the
flames have often been extinguished before the house in which
they began, has been half consumed.</p>

<p>In 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Rev. Mr. Whitefield,
    <a name="FNanchor_125_126" id="FNanchor_125_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_126" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
who had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant
preacher. He was at first permitted to preach in some of our
churches; but the clergy, taking a dislike to him, soon refused
him their pulpits, and he was obliged to preach in the fields.
The multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended his
sermons were enormous, and it was matter of speculation to me,
who was one of the number, to observe the extraordinary influence
of his oratory on his hearers, and how much they admired and
respected him, notwithstanding his common abuse of them by assuring
them they were naturally "half beasts and half devils." It
was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of
our inhabitants. From being thoughtless or indifferent about religion,
it seemed as if all the world were growing religious, so that
one could not walk through the town in an evening without
hearing psalms sung in different families of every street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
    And, it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air,
subject to its inclemencies, the building of a house to meet in
was no sooner proposed, and persons appointed to receive contributions,
but sufficient sums were soon received to procure the
ground and erect the building, which was one hundred feet long
and seventy broad, about the size of Westminster Hall;
    <a name="FNanchor_126_127" id="FNanchor_126_127"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_126_127" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and the
work was carried on with such spirit as to be finished in a much
shorter time than could have been expected. Both house and
ground were vested in trustees, expressly for the use of any
preacher of any religious persuasion who might desire to say
something to the people of Philadelphia; the design in building
not being to accommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants
in general; so that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to
send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would
find a pulpit at his service.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitefield, in leaving us, went preaching all the way
through the colonies to Georgia. The settlement of that province
had lately been begun, but, instead of being made with hardy,
industrious husbandmen, accustomed to labor,&mdash;the only people fit
for such an enterprise,&mdash;it was with families of broken shopkeepers
and other insolvent debtors, many of indolent and idle habits,
taken out of the jails, who, being set down in the woods, unqualified
for clearing land and unable to endure the hardships of a
new settlement, perished in numbers, leaving many helpless children
unprovided for.<a name="FNanchor_127_128" id="FNanchor_127_128"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_127_128" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The sight of their miserable situation inspired
the benevolent heart of Mr. Whitefield with the idea of
building an orphan house<a name="FNanchor_128_129" id="FNanchor_128_129"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_128_129" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> there, in which they might be supported
and educated. Returning northward, he preached up this charity,
and made large collections, for his eloquence had a wonderful
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
power over the hearts and purses of his hearers, of which I
myself was an instance.</p>

<p>I did not disapprove of the design, but, as Georgia was then
destitute of materials and workmen, and it was proposed to send
them from Philadelphia at a great expense, I thought it would
have been better to have built the house here, and brought the
children to it. This I advised; but he was resolute in his first
project, rejected my counsel, and I therefore refused to contribute.
I happened soon after to attend one of his sermons, in the
course of which I perceived he intended to finish with a collection,
and I silently resolved he should get nothing from me. I
had in my pocket a handful of copper money, three or four silver
dollars, and five pistoles in gold. As he proceeded I began to
soften, and concluded to give the coppers. Another stroke of
his oratory made me ashamed of that, and determined me to give
the silver; and he finished so admirably that I emptied my pocket
wholly into the collector's dish, gold and all. At this sermon there
was also one of our club, who, being of my sentiments respecting
the building in Georgia, and suspecting a collection might be intended,
had, by precaution, emptied his pockets before he came
from home. Toward the conclusion of the discourse, however,
he felt a strong desire to give, and applied to a neighbor who stood
near him, to borrow some money for the purpose. The application
was unfortunately to perhaps the only man in the company who
had the firmness not to be affected by the preacher. His answer
was: "At any other time, friend Hopkinson, I would lend to
thee freely; but not now, for thee seems to be out of thy right
senses."</p>

<p>Some of Mr. Whitefield's enemies affected to suppose that he
would apply these collections to his own private emolument; but
I, who was intimately acquainted with him, being employed in
printing his sermons and journals, etc., never had the least suspicion
of his integrity, but am to this day decidedly of opinion
that he was in all his conduct a perfectly honest man; and methinks
my testimony in his favor ought to have the more weight
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
as we had no religious connection. He used, indeed, sometimes
to pray for my conversion, but he never had the satisfaction of
believing that his prayers were heard. Ours was a mere civil
friendship, sincere on both sides, and lasted to his death.</p>

<p>The following instance will show something of the terms on
which we stood. Upon one of his arrivals from England at
Boston, he wrote to me that he should come soon to Philadelphia,
but knew not where he could lodge when there, as he understood
his old friend and host, Mr. Benezet, was removed to Germantown.
My answer was: "You know my house; if you can make
shift with its scanty accommodations, you will be most heartily
welcome." He replied that if I made that kind offer for Christ's
sake I should not miss of a reward; and I returned: "Don't let
me be mistaken; it was not for Christ's sake, but for your own
sake." One of our common acquaintance remarked that, knowing
it to be the custom of the saints, when they received any
favor, to shift the burden of the obligation from off their own
shoulders and place it in heaven, I had contrived to fix it on
earth.</p>

<p>The last time I saw Mr. Whitefield was in London, when he
consulted me about his orphan house concern, and his purpose
of appropriating it to the establishment of a college.</p>

<p>He had a loud and clear voice, and articulated his words and
sentences so perfectly that he might be heard and understood
at a great distance, especially as his auditors, however numerous,
observed the most exact silence. He preached one evening from
the top of the courthouse steps, which are in the middle of Market
Street, and on the west side of Second Street, which crosses it at
right angles. Both streets were filled with his hearers to a considerable
distance. Being among the hindmost in Market Street,
I had the curiosity to learn how far he could be heard, by retiring
backward down the street toward the river; and I found
his voice distinct till I came near Front Street, when some noise
in that street obscured it. Imagining then a semicircle, of which
my distance should be the radius, and that it were filled with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
auditors, to each of whom I allowed two square feet, I computed
that he might well be heard by more than thirty thousand. This
reconciled me to the newspaper accounts of his having preached
to twenty-five thousand people in the fields, and to the ancient
histories of generals haranguing whole armies, of which I had
sometimes doubted.</p>

<p>By hearing him often, I could distinguish easily between sermons
newly composed and those which he had often preached in
the course of his travels. His delivery of the latter was so improved
by frequent repetitions that every accent, every emphasis,
every modulation of voice, was so perfectly well turned and well
placed that, without being interested in the subject, one could
not help being pleased with the discourse; a pleasure of much the
same kind with that received from an excellent piece of music.
This is an advantage itinerant preachers have over those who are
stationary, as the latter cannot well improve their delivery of a
sermon by so many rehearsals.</p>

<p>His writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage
to his enemies. Unguarded expressions and even erroneous
opinions, delivered in preaching, might have been afterward explained
or qualified by supposing others that might have accompanied
them, or they might have been denied; but <i>litera scripta
manet</i>.<a name="FNanchor_129_130" id="FNanchor_129_130"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_129_130" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Critics
    attacked his writings violently, and with so much
appearance of reason as to diminish the number of his votaries
and prevent their increase; so that I am of opinion if he had never
written anything, he would have left behind him a much more numerous
and important sect, and his reputation might in that case
have been still growing, even after his death; as, there being nothing
of his writing on which to found a censure and give him a lower
character, his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign for him
as great a variety of excellences as their enthusiastic admiration
might wish him to have possessed.</p>

<p>My business was now continually augmenting, and my circumstances
growing daily easier, my newspaper having become very
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
profitable, as being for a time almost the only one in this and the
neighboring provinces. I experienced, too, the truth of the observation
that "after getting the first hundred pounds it is more
easy to get the second," money itself being of a prolific nature.</p>

<p>The partnership at Carolina having succeeded, I was encouraged
to engage in others, and to promote several of my workmen
who had behaved well, by establishing them with printing
houses in different colonies, on the same terms as that in Carolina.
Most of them did well, being enabled at the end of our
term, six years, to purchase the types of me and go on working
for themselves, by which means several families were raised. Partnerships
often finish in quarrels; but I was happy in this, that
mine were all carried on and ended amicably, owing, I think, a
good deal to the precaution of having very explicitly settled, in
our articles, everything to be done by or expected from each
partner, so that there was nothing to dispute, which precaution
I would therefore recommend to all who enter into partnership;
for, whatever esteem partners may have for and confidence in
each other at the time of the contract, little jealousies and disgusts
may arise, with ideas of inequality in the care and burden
of the business, etc., which are attended often with breach of
friendship and of the connection, perhaps with lawsuits and other
disagreeable consequences.</p>

<p>I had, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with my
being established in Pennsylvania. There were, however, two
things which I regretted,&mdash;there being no provision for defense, nor
for a complete education of youth; no militia, nor any college.
I therefore, in 1743, drew up a proposal for establishing an academy,
and at that time thinking the Rev. Mr. Peters, who was out
of employ, a fit person to superintend such an institution, I communicated
the project to him; but he, having more profitable
views in the service of the proprietaries, which succeeded, declined
the undertaking; and, not knowing another at that time suitable
for such a trust, I let the scheme lie awhile dormant. I succeeded
better the next year, 1744, in proposing and establishing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
a philosophical society.<a name="FNanchor_130_131" id="FNanchor_130_131"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_130_131" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The paper I wrote for that purpose will
be found among my writings when collected.</p>

<p>With respect to defense,&mdash;Spain having been several years at
war against Great Britain, and being at length joined by France,
which brought us into great danger, and the labored and long-continued
endeavor of our governor, Thomas, to prevail with our
Quaker Assembly<a name="FNanchor_131_132" id="FNanchor_131_132"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_131_132" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> to pass a militia law and make other provisions
for the security of the province, having proved abortive,&mdash;I
determined to try what might be done by a voluntary association
of the people. To promote this I first wrote and published a
pamphlet entitled "Plain Truth," in which I stated our defenseless
situation in strong lights, with the necessity of union and discipline
for our defense, and promised to propose in a few days an
association, to be generally signed for that purpose. The pamphlet
had a sudden and surprising effect. I was called upon for
the instrument of association, and having settled the draft of it
with a few friends, I appointed a meeting of the citizens in the
large building before mentioned. The house was pretty full. I
had prepared a number of printed copies, and provided pens and
ink dispersed all over the room. I harangued them a little on
the subject, read the paper and explained it, and then distributed
the copies, which were eagerly signed, not the least objection
being made.</p>

<p>When the company separated and the papers were collected,
we found above twelve hundred hands; and, other copies being
dispersed in the country, the subscribers amounted at length to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
upward of ten thousand. These all furnished themselves as soon
as they could with arms, formed themselves into companies and
regiments, chose their own officers, and met every week to be instructed
in the manual exercise and other parts of military discipline.
The women, by subscriptions among themselves, provided
silk colors, which they presented to the companies, painted with
different devices and mottoes which I supplied.</p>

<p>The officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia regiment,
being met, chose me for their colonel; but, conceiving
myself unfit, I declined that station, and recommended Mr. Lawrence,
a fine person and man of influence, who was accordingly
appointed. I then proposed a lottery<a name="FNanchor_132_133" id="FNanchor_132_133"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_132_133" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> to defray the expense of
building a battery below the town, and furnishing it with cannon.
It filled expeditiously, and the battery was soon erected, the merlons
    <a name="FNanchor_133_134" id="FNanchor_133_134"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_133_134" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
being framed of logs and filled with earth. We bought
some old cannon from Boston, but, these not being sufficient, we
wrote to England for more, soliciting at the same time our proprietaries
for some assistance, though without much expectation
of obtaining it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Colonel Lawrence, William Allen, Abram Taylor,
Esq., and myself were sent to New York by the associators, commissioned
to borrow some cannon of Governor Clinton. He at
first refused us peremptorily; but at dinner with his council, where
there was great drinking of Madeira wine, as the custom of that
place then was, he softened by degrees, and said he would lend
us six. After a few more bumpers he advanced to ten, and at
length he very good-naturedly conceded eighteen. They were
fine cannon, eighteen-pounders, with their carriages, which we
soon transported and mounted on our battery, where the associators
kept a nightly guard while the war lasted, and among the
rest I regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
    My activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor
and council; they took me into confidence, and I was consulted
by them in every measure wherein their concurrence was thought
useful to the association. Calling in the aid of religion, I proposed
to them the proclaiming a fast, to promote reformation
and implore the blessing of Heaven on our undertaking. They
embraced the motion; but as it was the first fast ever thought of
in the province, the secretary had no precedent from which to
draw the proclamation. My education in New England, where
a fast is proclaimed every year, was here of some advantage. I
drew it in the accustomed style. It was translated into German,
printed in both languages, and divulged through the province.
This gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing
their congregations to join in the association, and it would
probably have been general among all but Quakers if the peace
had not soon intervened.</p>

<p>It was thought by some of my friends that by my activity in
these affairs I should offend that sect, and thereby lose my interest
in the Assembly of the province, where they formed a great
majority. A young gentleman who had likewise some friends in
the House, and wished to succeed me as their clerk, acquainted
me that it was decided to displace me at the next election, and
he therefore, in good will, advised me to resign, as more consistent
with my honor than being turned out. My answer to him
was, that I had read or heard of some public man who made it
a rule never to ask for an office and never to refuse one when
offered to him. "I approve," says I, "of his rule, and will practice
it with a small addition: I shall never ask, never refuse, nor
ever resign an office. If they will have my office of clerk to dispose
of to another, they shall take it from me. I will not, by giving
it up, lose my right of some time or other making reprisals
    <a name="FNanchor_134_135" id="FNanchor_134_135"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_134_135" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
on my adversaries." I heard, however, no more of this; I was
chosen again unanimously, as usual, at the next election. Possibly,
as they disliked my late intimacy with the members of council,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
who had joined the governors in all the disputes about military
preparations with which the House had long been harassed, they
might have been pleased if I would voluntarily have left them;
but they did not care to displace me on account merely of my
zeal for the association, and they could not well give another
reason.</p>

<p>Indeed I had some cause to believe that the defense of the
country was not disagreeable to any of them, provided they were
not required to assist in it. And I found that a much greater
number of them than I could have imagined, though against
offensive war, were clearly for the defensive. Many pamphlets
pro and con were published on the subject, and some by good
Quakers in favor of defense, which I believe convinced most of
their younger people.</p>

<p>A transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into
their prevailing sentiments. It had been proposed that we should
encourage the scheme for building a battery, by laying out the
present stock, then about sixty pounds, in tickets of the lottery.
By our rules no money could be disposed of till the next meeting
after the proposal. The company consisted of thirty members,
of which twenty-two were Quakers, and eight, only, of other persuasions.
We eight punctually attended the meeting; but though
we thought that some of the Quakers would join us, we were
by no means sure of a majority. Only one Quaker, Mr. James
Morris, appeared to oppose the measure. He expressed much
sorrow that it had ever been proposed, as he said Friends were
all against it, and it would create such discord as might break up
the company. We told him that we saw no reason for that; we
were the minority, and if Friends were against the measure, and
outvoted us, we must and should, agreeably to the usage of all societies,
submit. When the hour for business arrived it was moved
to put the vote. He allowed we might then do it by the rules,
but as he could assure us that a number of members intended to
be present for the purpose of opposing it, it would be but candid
to allow a little time for their appearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
    While we were disputing this a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen
below desired to speak with me. I went down and found
they were two of our Quaker members. They told me that there
were eight of them assembled at a tavern just by; that they were
determined to come and vote with us if there should be occasion,
which they hoped would not be the case, and desired we would
not call for their assistance if we could do without it, as their voting
for such a measure might embroil them with their elders and
friends. Being thus secure of a majority, I went up, and after a
little seeming hesitation agreed to a delay of another hour. This
Mr. Morris allowed to be extremely fair. Not one of his opposing
friends appeared, at which he expressed great surprise, and
at the expiration of the hour we carried the resolution eight to
one; and as, of the twenty-two Quakers, eight were ready to vote
with us, and thirteen by their absence manifested that they were
not inclined to oppose the measure, I afterward estimated the proportion
of Quakers sincerely against defense as one to twenty-one
only; for these were all regular members of that society, and in
good reputation among them, and had due notice of what was proposed
at that meeting.</p>

<p>The honorable and learned Mr. Logan, who had always been
of that sect, was one who wrote an address to them, declaring
his approbation of defensive war and supporting his opinion by
many strong arguments. He put into my hands sixty pounds to
be laid out in lottery tickets for the battery, with directions to
apply what prizes might be drawn wholly to that service. He
told me the following anecdote of his old master, William Penn,
respecting defense. He came over from England, when a young
man, with that proprietary, and as his secretary. It was war time,
and their ship was chased by an armed vessel, supposed to be an
enemy. Their captain prepared for defense, but told William
Penn and his company of Quakers that he did not expect their
assistance, and they might retire into the cabin; which they did,
except James Logan, who chose to stay upon deck, and was quartered
to a gun. The supposed enemy proved a friend, so there
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
was no fighting; but when the secretary went down to communicate
the intelligence, William Penn rebuked him severely for staying
upon deck and undertaking to assist in defending the vessel,
contrary to the principles of Friends, especially as it had not been
required by the captain. This reproof, being before all the company,
piqued the secretary, who answered: "I being thy servant,
why did thee not order me to come down? But thee was
willing enough that I should stay and help to fight the ship when
thee thought there was danger."</p>

<p>My being many years in the Assembly, the majority of which
were constantly Quakers, gave me frequent opportunities of seeing
the embarrassment given them by their principle against war
whenever application was made to them, by order of the Crown,
to grant aids for military purposes. They were unwilling to
offend government, on the one hand, by a direct refusal, and their
friends, the body of the Quakers, on the other, by a compliance
contrary to their principles; hence a variety of evasions to avoid
complying, and modes of disguising the compliance when it became
unavoidable. The common mode at last was to grant
money under the phrase of its being "for the King's use," and
never to inquire how it was applied.</p>

<p>But if the demand was not directly from the Crown, that phrase
was found not so proper, and some other was to be invented.
As, when powder was wanting (I think it was for the garrison at
Louisburg<a name="FNanchor_135_136" id="FNanchor_135_136"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_135_136" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>), and the government of New England solicited a
grant of some from Pennsylvania, which was much urged on the
House by Governor Thomas, they could not grant money to buy
powder, because that was an ingredient of war; but they voted
an aid to New England of three thousand pounds, to be put into
the hands of the governor, and appropriated it for the purchasing
of bread, flour, wheat, or other grain. Some of the council, desirous
of giving the House still further embarrassment, advised
the governor not to accept provision, as not being the thing he
had demanded; but he replied: "I shall take the money, for I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
understand very well their meaning; 'other grain' is gunpowder,"
which he accordingly bought, and they never objected to it.</p>

<p>It was in allusion to this fact that, when in our fire company
we feared the success of our proposal in favor of the lottery, and
I had said to my friend Mr. Syng, one of our members: "If we
fail, let us move the purchase of a fire engine with the money; the
Quakers can have no objection to that; and then, if you nominate
me and I you as a committee for that purpose, we will buy a
great gun, which is certainly a fire engine,"&mdash;"I see," says he,
"you have improved by being so long in the Assembly; your
equivocal project would be just a match for their 'wheat or other
grain.'"</p>

<p>These embarrassments that the Quakers suffered from having
established and published it as one of their principles that no kind
of war was lawful, and which, being once published, they could
not afterward, however they might change their minds, easily get
rid of, reminds me of what I think a more prudent conduct in
another sect among us, that of the Dunkers.<a name="FNanchor_136_137" id="FNanchor_136_137"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_136_137" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> I was acquainted
with one of its founders, Michael Welfare, soon after it appeared.
He complained to me that they were grievously calumniated by
the zealots of other persuasions, and charged with abominable
principles and practices to which they were utter strangers. I
told him this had always been the case with new sects, and that,
to put a stop to such abuse, I imagined it might be well to publish
the articles of their belief and the rules of their discipline.
He said that it had been proposed among them, but not agreed
to, for this reason: "When we were first drawn together as a
society," says he, "it had pleased God to enlighten our minds so
far as to see that some doctrines, which we once esteemed truths,
were errors; and that others, which we have esteemed errors, were
real truths. From time to time He has been pleased to afford us
further light, and our principles have been improving and our errors
diminishing. Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
end of this progression and at the perfection of spiritual or theological
knowledge, and we fear that if we should once print our
confession of faith we should feel ourselves as if bound and confined
by it, and perhaps be unwilling to receive further improvement,
and our successors still more so, as conceiving what we,
their elders and founders, had done to be something sacred, never
to be departed from."</p>

<p>This modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history
of mankind, every other sect supposing itself in possession of
all truth, and that those who differ are so far in the wrong. Like
a man traveling in foggy weather; those at some distance before
him on the road he sees wrapped up in the fog as well as those
behind him, and also the people in the fields on each side, but
near him all appears clear, though in truth he is as much in the
fog as any of them. To avoid this kind of embarrassment the
Quakers have of late years been gradually declining the public
service in the Assembly and in the magistracy, choosing rather to
quit their power than their principle.</p>

<p>In order of time I should have mentioned before that, having
in 1742 invented an open stove<a name="FNanchor_137_138" id="FNanchor_137_138"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_137_138" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> for the better warming of rooms
and at the same time saving fuel, as the fresh air admitted was
warmed in entering, I made a present of the model to Mr. Robert
Grace, one of my early friends, who, having an iron furnace,
found the casting of the plates for these stoves a profitable thing,
as they were growing in demand.<a name="FNanchor_N_20" id="FNanchor_N_20"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_20" class="fnanchor">[n]</a>] To promote that demand I
wrote and published a pamphlet entitled, "An Account of the
new-invented Pennsylvania Fireplaces; wherein their Construction
and Manner of Operation is particularly explained; their
Advantages above every other Method of warming Rooms demonstrated;
and all Objections that have been raised against the Use
of them answered and obviated," etc. This pamphlet had a good
effect. Governor Thomas was so pleased with the construction
of this stove, as described in it, that he offered to give me a
patent for the sole vending of them for a term of years; but I declined
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
it from a principle which has ever weighed with me on such
occasions; namely, that as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions
of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve
others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and
generously.</p>

<p>An ironmonger in London, however, assuming a good deal of
my pamphlet, and working it up into his own, and making some
small changes in the machine, which rather hurt its operation, got
a patent for it there, and made, as I was told, a little fortune by
it. And this is not the only instance of patents taken out for my
inventions by others,&mdash;though not always with the same success,&mdash;which
I never contested, as having no desire of profiting by patents
myself, and hating disputes. The use of these fireplaces in
very many houses, both of this and the neighboring colonies, has
been and is a great saving of wood to the inhabitants.</p>

<hr />
<h2>§ 7. PROJECTS FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD.</h2>

<p>Peace being concluded, and the association business therefore
at an end, I turned my thoughts again to the affair of
establishing an academy. The first step I took was to associate
in the design a number of active friends, of whom the Junto
furnished a good part. The next was to write and publish a
pamphlet entitled "Proposals relating to the Education of Youth
in Pennsylvania." This I distributed among the principal inhabitants
gratis; and as soon as I could suppose their minds
a little prepared by the perusal of it, I set on foot a subscription
for opening and supporting an academy. It was to be paid in
quotas yearly for five years. By so dividing it I judged the subscription
might be larger, and I believe it was so, amounting to
no less, if I remember right, than five thousand pounds.</p>

<p>In the introduction to these Proposals I stated their publication,
not as an act of mine, but of some "public-spirited gentlemen,"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
avoiding as much as I could, according to my usual rule, the presenting
myself to the public as the author of any scheme for their
benefit.</p>

<p>The subscribers, to carry the project into immediate execution,
chose out of their number twenty-four trustees, and appointed
Mr. Francis, then attorney-general, and myself to draw up constitutions
for the government of the academy; which being done
and signed, a house was hired, masters engaged, and the schools
opened, I think, in the same year, 1749.</p>

<p>The scholars increasing fast, the house was soon found too
small, and we were looking out for a piece of ground, properly
situated, with intention to build, when Providence threw into our
way a large house ready built, which, with a few alterations, might
well serve our purpose. This was the building before mentioned,
erected by the hearers of Mr. Whitefield,<a name="FNanchor_138_139" id="FNanchor_138_139"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_138_139" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and was obtained for
us in the following manner.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the contributions to this building being
made by people of different sects, care was taken in the nomination
of trustees, in whom the building and ground was to be
vested, that a predominancy should not be given to any sect, lest
in time that predominancy might be a means of appropriating the
whole to the use of such sect, contrary to the original intention.
It was therefore that one of each sect was appointed; namely,
one Church of England man, one Presbyterian, one Baptist, one
Moravian,<a name="FNanchor_139_140" id="FNanchor_139_140"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_139_140" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> etc.; those,
    in case of vacancy by death, were to fill
it by election from among the contributors. The Moravian happened
not to please his colleagues, and on his death they resolved
to have no other of that sect. The difficulty then was, how to
avoid having two of some other sect by means of the new choice.</p>

<p>Several persons were named, and for that reason not agreed to.
At length one mentioned me, with the observation that I was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
merely an honest man and of no sect at all, which prevailed with
them to choose me. The enthusiasm which existed when the
house was built had long since abated, and its trustees had not
been able to procure fresh contributions for paying the ground
rent and discharging some other debts the building had occasioned,
which embarrassed them greatly. Being now a member
of both sets of trustees, that for the building and that for the
academy, I had a good opportunity of negotiating with both, and
brought them finally to an agreement, by which the trustees for
the building were to cede it to those of the academy, the latter
undertaking to discharge the debt, to keep forever open in the
building a large hall for occasional preachers, according to the
original intention, and maintain a free school for the instruction
of poor children. Writings were accordingly drawn, and on paying
the debts the trustees of the academy were put in possession
of the premises; and by dividing the great and lofty hall into
stories, and different rooms above and below for the several
schools, and purchasing some additional ground, the whole was
soon made fit for our purpose, and the scholars removed into the
building. The care and trouble of agreeing with the workmen,
purchasing materials, and superintending the work, fell upon me;
and I went through it the more cheerfully as it did not then interfere
with my private business, having the year before taken a
very able, industrious, and honest partner, Mr. David Hall, with
whose character I was well acquainted, as he had worked for me
four years. He took off my hands all care of the printing office,
paying me punctually my share of the profits. This partnership
continued eighteen years, successfully for us both.</p>

<p>The trustees of the academy after a while were incorporated
by a charter from the government; their funds were increased by
contributions in Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries,
to which the Assembly has since made considerable addition; and
thus was established the present University of Philadelphia. I
have been continued one of its trustees from the beginning, now
near forty years, and have had the very great pleasure of seeing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
a number of the youth who have received their education in it
distinguished by their improved abilities, serviceable in public
stations, and ornaments to their country.</p>

<p>When I disengaged myself as above mentioned from private
business, I flattered myself that, by the sufficient though moderate
fortune I had acquired, I had secured leisure during the rest of
my life for philosophical studies and amusements. I purchased
all Dr. Spence's apparatus, who had come from England to lecture
here, and I proceeded in my electrical experiments with great
alacrity. But the public, now considering me as a man of leisure,
laid hold of me for their purposes, every part of our civil government,
and almost at the same time, imposing some duty upon me.
The governor put me into the commission of the peace, the corporation
of the city chose me of the common council and soon
after an alderman, and the citizens at large chose me a burgess
    <a name="FNanchor_140_141" id="FNanchor_140_141"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_140_141" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
to represent them in Assembly. This latter station was the more
agreeable to me, as I was at length tired with sitting there to hear
debates in which, as clerk, I could take no part, and which were
often so unentertaining that I was induced to amuse myself with
making magic squares<a name="FNanchor_141_142" id="FNanchor_141_142"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_141_142" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> or circles, or anything to avoid weariness;
and I conceived my becoming a member would enlarge my power
of doing good. I would not, however, insinuate that my ambition
was not flattered by all these promotions. It certainly
was, for, considering my low beginning, they were great things to
me, and they were still more pleasing as being so many spontaneous
testimonies of the public good opinion, and by me entirely
unsolicited.</p>

<p>The office of justice of the peace I tried a little by attending a
few courts and sitting on the bench to hear causes; but finding
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
that more knowledge of the common law than I possessed was
necessary to act in that station with credit, I gradually withdrew
from it, excusing myself by my being obliged to attend the higher
duties of a legislator in the Assembly. My election to this trust
was repeated every year for ten years without my ever asking any
elector for his vote, or signifying, either directly or indirectly, any
desire of being chosen. On taking my seat in the House my son
was appointed their clerk.</p>

<p>The year following, a treaty being to be held with the Indians
at Carlisle, the governor sent a message to the House, proposing
that they should nominate some of their members, to be joined
with some members of council, as commissioners for that purpose.
The House named the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself;
and, being commissioned, we went to Carlisle and met the Indians
accordingly.</p>

<p>As those people are extremely apt to get drunk, and when so
are very quarrelsome and disorderly, we strictly forbade the selling
any liquor to them; and when they complained of this restriction,
we told them that if they would continue sober during the
treaty, we would give them plenty of rum when business was over.
They promised this, and they kept their promise, because they
could get no liquor, and the treaty was conducted very orderly,
and concluded to mutual satisfaction. They then claimed and
received the rum.</p>

<p>This was in the afternoon; they were near one hundred men,
women, and children, and were lodged in temporary cabins, built
in the form of a square, just without the town. In the evening,
hearing a great noise among them, the commissioners walked out
to see what was the matter. We found they had made a great
bonfire in the middle of the square. They were all drunk, men
and women, quarreling and fighting. Their dark colored bodies,
half naked, seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire, running
after and beating one another with firebrands, accompanied by
their horrid yellings, formed a scene the most resembling our
ideas of hell that could well be imagined, There was no appeasing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the tumult, and we retired to our lodging. At midnight a
number of them came thundering to our door, demanding more
rum, of which we took no notice.</p>

<p>The next day, sensible they had misbehaved in giving us that
disturbance, they sent three of their old counselors to make their
apology. The orator acknowledged the fault, but laid it upon
the rum; and then endeavored to excuse the rum by saying: "The
Great Spirit, who made all things, made everything for some use,
and whatever use he designed anything for, that use it should
always be put to. Now when he made rum he said, 'Let this
be for the Indians to get drunk with,' and it must be so." And,
indeed, if it be the design of Providence to extirpate these savages
in order to make room for cultivators of the earth, it seems not improbable
that rum may be the appointed means. It has already
annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the seacoast.</p>

<p>In 1751 Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine, conceived
the idea of establishing a hospital in Philadelphia (a very
beneficent design which has been ascribed to me but was originally
his) for the reception and cure of poor sick persons, whether
inhabitants of the province or strangers. He was zealous and active
in endeavoring to procure subscriptions for it, but the proposal
being a novelty in America, and at first not well understood,
he met with but small success.</p>

<p>At length he came to me with the compliment that he found
there was no such thing as carrying a public-spirited project
through without my being concerned in it. "For," says he, "I
am often asked by those to whom I propose subscribing, 'Have
you consulted Franklin upon this business? And what does he
think of it?' And when I tell them that I have not (supposing
it rather out of your line), they do not subscribe, but say they
will consider of it." I inquired into the nature and probable
utility of his scheme, and receiving from him a very satisfactory
explanation, I not only subscribed to it myself, but engaged heartily
in the design of procuring subscriptions from others. Previously,
however, to the solicitation, I endeavored to prepare the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
minds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers,
which was my usual custom in such cases, but which he had
omitted.</p>

<p>The subscriptions afterward were more free and generous; but,
beginning to flag, I saw they would be insufficient without some
assistance from the Assembly, and therefore proposed to petition
for it, which was done. The country members did not at first
relish the project. They objected that it could only be serviceable
to the city, and therefore the citizens alone should be at the
expense of it; and they doubted whether the citizens themselves
generally approved of it. My allegation on the contrary, that
it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of our being
able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations, they
considered as a most extravagant supposition and utterly impossible.</p>

<p>On this I formed my plan; and, asking leave to bring in a bill
    <a name="FNanchor_142_143" id="FNanchor_142_143"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_142_143" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
for incorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their
petition, and granting them a blank sum of money, which leave
was obtained chiefly on the consideration that the House could
throw the bill out if they did not like it, I drew it so as to make
the important clause a conditional one, namely: "And be it enacted,
by the authority aforesaid, that when the said contributors
shall have met and chosen their managers and treasurer, <i>and shall
have raised by their contributions a capital stock of &mdash;&mdash; value</i>, (the
yearly interest of which is to be applied to the accommodating of
the sick poor in the said hospital, free of charge for diet, attendance,
advice, and medicines,) <i>and shall make the same appear to the
satisfaction of the speaker of the Assembly for the time being</i>, that
<i>then</i> it shall and may be lawful for the said speaker, and he is hereby
required, to sign an order on the provincial treasurer for the payment
of two thousand pounds, in two yearly payments, to the treasurer
of the said hospital, to be applied to the founding, building,
and finishing of the same."</p>

<p>This condition carried the bill through; for the members who
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
had opposed the grant, and now conceived they might have the
credit of being charitable without the expense, agreed to its passage;
and then, in soliciting subscriptions among the people, we
urged the conditional promise of the law as an additional motive
to give, since every man's donation would be doubled; thus the
clause worked both ways. The subscriptions accordingly soon
exceeded the requisite sum, and we claimed and received the
public gift, which enabled us to carry the design into execution.
A convenient and handsome building was soon erected; the
institution has, by constant experience, been found useful, and
flourishes to this day; and I do not remember any of my political
maneuvers the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure,
or wherein, after thinking of it, I more easily excused myself
for having made some use of cunning.</p>

<p>It was about this time that another projector, the Rev. Gilbert
Tennent, came to me with a request that I would assist him in
procuring a subscription for erecting a new meetinghouse. It
was to be for the use of a congregation he had gathered among
the Presbyterians who were originally disciples of Mr. Whitefield.
Unwilling to make myself disagreeable to my fellow-citizens by
too frequently soliciting their contributions, I absolutely refused.
He then desired I would furnish him with a list of the names
of persons I knew by experience to be generous and public-spirited.
I thought it would be unbecoming in me, after their
kind compliance with my solicitations, to mark them out to be
worried by other beggars, and therefore refused also to give such
a list. He then desired I would at least give him my advice.
"That I will readily do," said I; "and in the first place, I advise
you to apply to all those whom you know will give something;
next, to those whom you are uncertain whether they will give anything
or not, and show them the list of those who have given; and,
lastly, do not neglect those who you are sure will give nothing, for
in some of them you may be mistaken." He laughed and thanked
me, and said he would take my advice. He did so, for he asked of
everybody, and he obtained a much larger sum than he expected,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
with which he erected the capacious and very elegant meetinghouse
that stands in Arch Street.<a name="FNanchor_143_144" id="FNanchor_143_144"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_143_144" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Our city, though laid out with a beautiful regularity, the streets
large, straight, and crossing each other at right angles, had the
disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpaved, and in
wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages plowed them into a
quagmire, so that it was difficult to cross them, and in dry weather
the dust was offensive. I had lived near what was called the
Jersey Market, and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud
while purchasing their provisions. A strip of ground down the
middle of that market was at length paved with brick, so that,
being once in the market, they had firm footing, but were often
over shoes in dirt to get there. By talking and writing on the
subject I was at length instrumental in getting the street paved
with stone between the market and the bricked foot pavement that
was on each side next the houses. This for some time gave an
easy access to the market, dry-shod; but, the rest of the street not
being paved, whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this
pavement, it shook off and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon
covered with mire, which was not removed, the city as yet having
no scavengers.</p>

<p>After some inquiry I found a poor, industrious man, who was
willing to undertake keeping the pavement clean by sweeping it
twice a week, carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbors'
doors for the sum of sixpence per month to be paid by each
house.<a name="FNanchor_N_21" id="FNanchor_N_21"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_21" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> I then wrote and
    printed a paper setting forth the advantages
to the neighborhood that might be obtained by this
small expense: the greater ease in keeping our houses clean,
so much dirt not being brought in by people's feet; the benefit
to the shops by more custom, etc., as buyers could more easily
get at them, and by not having, in windy weather, the dust
blown in upon their goods, etc. I sent one of these papers to
each house, and in a day or two went round to see who would
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
subscribe an agreement to pay these sixpences. It was unanimously
signed, and for a time well executed. All the inhabitants
of the city were delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement
that surrounded the market, it being a convenience to all; and
this raised a general desire to have all the streets paved, and made
the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose.</p>

<p>After some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and brought
it into the Assembly. It was just before I went to England in
1757, and did not pass till I was gone, and then with an alteration
in the mode of assessment which I thought not for the better,
but with an additional provision for lighting as well as paving the
streets, which was a great improvement. It was by a private
person, the late Mr. John Clifton,&mdash;his giving a sample of the
utility of lamps by placing one at his door,&mdash;that the people
were first impressed with the idea of enlighting all the city. The
honor of this public benefit has also been ascribed to me, but it
belongs truly to that gentleman. I did but follow his example,
and have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our
lamps, as differing from the globe lamps we were at first supplied
with from London. Those we found inconvenient in these respects:
they admitted no air below; the smoke, therefore, did not
readily go out above, but circulated in the globe, lodged on its
inside, and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford,
giving, besides, the daily trouble of wiping them clean; and an
accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it and render
it totally useless. I therefore suggested the composing them of
four flat panes, with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke,
and crevices admitting air below to facilitate the ascent of the
smoke. By this means they were kept clean, and did not grow
dark in a few hours, as the London lamps do, but continued
bright till morning, and an accidental stroke would generally
break but a single pane, easily repaired.</p>

<p>I have sometimes wondered that the Londoners did not, from
the effect holes in the bottom of the globe lamps used at Vauxhall
    <a name="FNanchor_144_145" id="FNanchor_144_145"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_144_145" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
have in keeping them clean, learn to have such holes in their
street lamps. But, these holes being made for another purpose,
namely, to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a
little flax hanging down through them, the other use, of letting in
air, seems not to have been thought of; and therefore, after the
lamps have been lit a few hours, the streets of London are very
poorly illuminated.</p>

<p>The mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I
proposed, when in London, to Dr. Fothergill, who was among the
best men I have known, and a great promoter of useful projects.
I had observed that the streets, when dry, were never swept, and
the light dust carried away; but it was suffered to accumulate till
wet weather reduced it to mud, and then, after lying some days
so deep on the pavement that there was no crossing but in paths
kept clean by poor people with brooms, it was with great labor
raked together and thrown up into carts open above, the sides of
which suffered some of the slush at every jolt on the pavement to
shake out and fall, sometimes to the annoyance of foot passengers.
The reason given for not sweeping the dusty streets was that the
dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses.</p>

<p>An accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping
might be done in a little time. I found at my door in Craven
Street<a name="FNanchor_145_146" id="FNanchor_145_146"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_145_146" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> one
    morning, a poor woman sweeping my pavement with
a birch broom. She appeared very pale and feeble, as just come
out of a fit of sickness. I asked who employed her to sweep
there. She said, "Nobody; but I am very poor and in distress,
and I sweeps before gentlefolkses doors, and hopes they will give
me something." I bid her sweep the whole street clean, and I
would give her a shilling. This was at nine o'clock; at twelve she
came for the shilling. From the slowness I saw at first in her
working I could scarce believe that the work was done so soon,
and sent my servant to examine it, who reported that the whole
street was swept perfectly clean, and all the dust placed in the
gutter, which was in the middle; and the next rain washed it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
quite away, so that the pavement, and even the kennel,
    <a name="FNanchor_146_147" id="FNanchor_146_147"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_146_147" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> were
perfectly clean.</p>

<p>I then judged that if that feeble woman could sweep such a
street in three hours, a strong, active man might have done it in
half the time. And here let me remark the convenience of having
but one gutter in such a narrow street, running down its middle,
instead of two, one on each side, near the footway; for where all
the rain that falls on a street runs from the sides and meets in the
middle, it forms there a current strong enough to wash away all
the mud it meets with; but when divided into two channels, it is
often too weak to cleanse either, and only makes the mud it finds
more fluid, so that the wheels of carriages and feet of horses throw
and dash it upon the foot pavement, which is thereby rendered
foul and slippery, and sometimes splash it upon those who are
walking. My proposal communicated to the good doctor was as
follows:</p>

<p>"For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets
of London and Westminster<a name="FNanchor_147_148" id="FNanchor_147_148"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_147_148" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> it is proposed that the several watchmen
be contracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons,
and the mud raked up at other times, each in the several streets
and lanes of his round; that they be furnished with brooms and
other proper instruments for these purposes, to be kept at their
respective stands, ready to furnish the poor people they may employ
in the service.</p>

<p>"That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into
heaps at proper distances, before the shops and windows of houses
are usually opened, when the scavengers, with close-covered carts,
shall also carry it all away.</p>

<p>"That the mud, when raked up, be not left in heaps to be
spread abroad again by the wheels of carriages and trampling of
horses, but that the scavengers be provided with bodies of carts,
not placed high upon wheels, but low upon sliders, with lattice
bottoms, which, being covered with straw, will retain the mud
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
thrown into them, and permit the water to drain from it, whereby
it will become much lighter, water making the greatest part of its
weight; these bodies of carts to be placed at convenient distances,
and the mud brought to them in wheelbarrows, they remaining
where placed till the mud is drained, and then horses brought to
draw them away."</p>

<p>I have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part
of this proposal, on account of the narrowness of some streets, and
the difficulty of placing the draining sleds so as not to encumber
too much the passage; but I am still of opinion that the former,
requiring the dust to be swept up and carried away before the
shops are open, is very practicable in summer, when the days are
long; for, in walking through the Strand and Fleet Street one
morning at seven o'clock, I observed there was not one shop open,
though it had been daylight and the sun up above three hours,
the inhabitants of London choosing voluntarily to live much by
candlelight and sleep by sunshine; and yet they often complain,
a little absurdly, of the duty on candles and the high price of
tallow.</p>

<p>Some may think these trifling matters, not worth minding or relating;
but when they consider that though dust blown into the
eyes of a single person, or into a single shop, on a windy day is
but of small importance, yet the great number of the instances in
a populous city, and its frequent repetitions, give it weight and
consequence, perhaps they will not censure very severely those
who bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature.
Human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good
fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur
every day. Thus, if you teach a poor young man to shave himself
and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to the
happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas. The
money may be soon spent, the regret only remaining of having
foolishly consumed it; but in the other case, he escapes the frequent
vexation of waiting for barbers, and of their sometimes
dirty fingers, offensive breaths, and dull razors. He shaves when
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
most convenient to him, and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being
done with a good instrument.<a name="FNanchor_148_149" id="FNanchor_148_149"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_148_149" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> With these sentiments I have
hazarded the few preceding pages, hoping they may afford hints
which some time or other may be useful to a city I love, having
lived many years in it very happily, and perhaps to some of our
towns in America.</p>

<p>Having been for some time employed by the postmaster-general
of America as his comptroller<a name="FNanchor_149_150" id="FNanchor_149_150"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_149_150" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> in regulating several offices,
and bringing the officers to account, I was, upon his death, in
1753, appointed, jointly with Mr. William Hunter, to succeed
him, by a commission from the postmaster-general in England.
The American office never had hitherto paid anything to that of
Great Britain. We were to have six hundred pounds a year between
us, if we could make that sum out of the profits of the
office. To do this a variety of improvements were necessary.
Some of these were inevitably at first expensive, so that in the
first four years the office became above nine hundred pounds in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
<a name="debt" id="debt"></a>debt to us; but it soon after began to repay us, and before I
was displaced by a freak of the ministers,<a name="FNanchor_150_151" id="FNanchor_150_151"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_150_151" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> of which I shall speak
hereafter, we had brought it to yield three times as much clear
revenue to the Crown as the post office of Ireland. Since that
imprudent transaction they have received from it&mdash;not one
farthing!</p>

<p>The business of the post office occasioned my taking a journey
this year to New England, where the College of Cambridge,
    <a name="FNanchor_151_152" id="FNanchor_151_152"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_151_152" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> of
their own motion, presented me with the degree of Master of Arts.
Yale College, in Connecticut, had before made me a similar compliment.
Thus, without studying in any college, I came to partake
of their honors. They were conferred in consideration of
my improvements and discoveries in the electric branch of natural
philosophy.</p>

<p>In 1754, war with France being again apprehended, a congress
of commissioners from the different colonies was, by an order of
the Lords of Trade,<a name="FNanchor_152_153" id="FNanchor_152_153"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_152_153" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> to be assembled at Albany, there to confer
with the chiefs of the Six Nations<a name="FNanchor_153_154" id="FNanchor_153_154"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_153_154" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> concerning the means of defending
both their country and ours. Governor Hamilton, having
received this order, acquainted the House with it, requesting
they would furnish proper presents for the Indians, to be given on
this occasion, and naming the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself to
join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr. Secretary Peters as commissioners
to act for Pennsylvania. The House approved the nomination,
and provided the goods for the present, though they did not much
like treating out of the provinces; and we met the other commissioners
at Albany about the middle of June.</p>

<p>In our way thither I projected and drew a plan for the union
of all the colonies under one government, so far as might be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
necessary for defense and other important general purposes. As
we passed through New York I had there shown my project to
Mr. James Alexander and Mr. Kennedy, two gentlemen of great
knowledge in public affairs; and, being fortified by their approbation,
I ventured to lay it before the congress. It then appeared
that several of the commissioners had formed plans of the same
kind. A previous question was first taken, whether a union
should be established, which passed in the affirmative unanimously.
A committee was then appointed, one member from
each colony, to consider the several plans and report. Mine
happened to be preferred, and, with a few amendments, was
accordingly reported.</p>

<p>By this plan the general government was to be administered by
a president-general, appointed and supported by the Crown, and
a grand council was to be chosen by the representatives of the
people of the several colonies, met in their respective assemblies.
The debates upon it in congress went on daily, hand in hand with
the Indian business. Many objections and difficulties were started,
but at length they were all overcome, and the plan was unanimously
agreed to, and copies ordered to be transmitted to the
Board of Trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces.
Its fate was singular; the assemblies did not adopt it, as they all
thought there was too much prerogative<a name="FNanchor_154_155" id="FNanchor_154_155"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_154_155" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> in it, and in England it
was judged to have too much of the democratic.
    <a name="FNanchor_155_156" id="FNanchor_155_156"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_155_156" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The Board of
Trade, therefore, did not approve of it nor recommend it for the
approbation of his Majesty; but another scheme was formed, supposed
to answer the same purpose better, whereby the governors
of the provinces, with some members of their respective councils,
were to meet and order the raising of troops, building of forts,
etc., and to draw on the treasury of Great Britain for the expense,
which was afterward to be refunded by an act of Parliament laying
a tax on America. My plan, with my reasons in support of
it, is to be found among my political papers that are printed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
    Being the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation
with Governor Shirley upon both the plans. Part of what passed
between us on the occasion may also be seen among those papers.
The different and contrary reasons of dislike to my plan make
me suspect that it was really the true medium, and I am still of
opinion it would have been happy for both sides the water if it
had been adopted. The colonies, so united, would have been
sufficiently strong to defend themselves; there would then have
been no need of troops from England. Of course the subsequent
pretense for taxing America, and the bloody contest it occasioned,
would have been avoided. But such mistakes are not new; history
is full of the errors of states and princes.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Those who govern, having much business on their hands, do
not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying
into execution new projects. The best public measures are
therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom, but forced by
the occasion.</p>

<p>The governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the
Assembly, expressed his approbation of the plan, as appearing
to him to be drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment,
and therefore recommended it as "well worthy of their
closest and most serious attention." The House, however, by the
management of a certain member, took it up when I happened to
be absent, which I thought not very fair, and reprobated it without
paying any attention to it at all, to my no small mortification.</p>

<p>In my journey to Boston this year I met at New York with our
new governor, Mr. Morris, just arrived there from England, with
whom I had been before intimately acquainted. He brought a
commission to supersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tired with the disputes
his proprietary instructions subjected him to, had resigned.
Mr. Morris asked me if I thought he must expect as uncomfortable
an administration. I said, "No; you may, on the contrary,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
have a very comfortable one, if you will only take care not to
enter into any dispute with the Assembly." "My dear friend,"
says he, pleasantly, "how can you advise my avoiding disputes?
You know I love disputing; it is one of my greatest pleasures.
However, to show the regard I have for your counsel, I promise
you I will, if possible, avoid them." He had some reason for loving
to dispute, being eloquent, an acute sophister, and therefore
generally successful in argumentative conversation. He had been
brought up to it from a boy, his father, as I have heard, accustoming
his children to dispute with one another for his diversion
while sitting at table after dinner. But I think the practice was
not wise; for in the course of my observation, these disputing,
contradicting, and confuting people are generally unfortunate in
their affairs. They get victory sometimes, but they never get
good will, which would be of more use to them. We parted, he
going to Philadelphia and I to Boston.</p>

<p>In returning I met at New York with the votes of the Assembly,
by which it appeared that, notwithstanding his promise to
me, he and the House were already in high contention; and it
was a continual battle between them as long as he retained the
government.</p>

<p>I had my share of it; for, as soon as I got back to my seat
in the Assembly, I was put on every committee for answering
his speeches and messages, and by the committees always desired
to make the drafts. Our answers, as well as his messages, were
often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive, and, as he knew I
wrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined that when we
met we could hardly avoid cutting throats; but he was so good-natured
a man that no personal difference between him and me
was occasioned by the contest, and we often dined together.</p>

<p>One afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in
the street. "Franklin," says he, "you must go home with me
and spend the evening; I am to have some company that you
will like;" and, taking me by the arm, he led me to his house. In
gay conversation over our wine after supper, he told us jokingly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
<a name="that" id="that"></a>that he much admired the idea of Sancho Panza,
    <a name="FNanchor_156_157" id="FNanchor_156_157"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_156_157" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> who, when it
was proposed to give him a government, requested it might be a
government of blacks, as then, if he could not agree with his
people, he might sell them. One of his friends, who sat next
to me, says, "Franklin, why do you continue to side with these
Quakers? Had not you better sell them? The proprietor would
give you a good price." "The governor," says I, "has not yet
blacked them enough." He, indeed, had labored hard to blacken
the Assembly in all his messages, but they wiped off his coloring
as fast as he laid it on, and placed it in return thick upon his own
face; so that, finding he was likely to be negrofied himself, he, as
well as Mr. Hamilton, grew tired of the contest, and quitted the
government.</p>

<p>These public quarrels were all at bottom owing to the proprietaries,
our hereditary governors, who, when any expense was to
be incurred for the defense of their province, with incredible
meanness instructed their deputies<a name="FNanchor_157_158" id="FNanchor_157_158"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_157_158" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> to pass no act for levying
the necessary taxes, unless their vast estates were in the same act
expressly excused, and they had even taken bonds of these deputies
to observe such instructions. The Assemblies for three
years held out against this injustice, though constrained to bend
at last. At length Captain Denny, who was Governor Morris's
successor, ventured to disobey those instructions. How that was
brought about I will show hereafter.</p>

<p>But I am got forward too fast with my story. There are still
some transactions to be mentioned that happened during the administration
of Governor Morris.</p>

</p>

<p>
"'I found him [Franklin] in his little room among his papers. He received
me very politely, and immediately entered into conversation about the western
country. His room makes a singular appearance, being filled with old
philosophical instruments, papers, boxes, tables, and stools. About ten
o'clock he placed some water on the fire, but not being expert through his
great age, I desired him to give me the pleasure of assisting him. He thanked
me, and replied that he ever made it a point to wait upon himself, and, although
he began to find himself infirm, he was determined not to increase his
infirmities by giving way to them. After the water was hot, I observed his
object was to shave himself, which operation he performed without a glass
and with great expedition. I asked him if he ever employed a barber; he
answered: "No; I think happiness does not consist so much in particular

be able in his old age to do those little things which, being unable to perform

<h2>§ 8. FRANKLIN ACTS IN CONCERT WITH BRADDOCK'S ARMY.<br />
ORGANIZATION OF MILITIA.</h2>

<p>War being in a manner commenced with France,
    <a name="FNanchor_158_159" id="FNanchor_158_159"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_158_159" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> the government
of Massachusetts Bay projected an attack upon
Crown Point,<a name="FNanchor_159_160" id="FNanchor_159_160"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_159_160" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and sent Mr. Quincy to Pennsylvania, and Mr.
Pownall, afterward Governor Pownall, to New York, to solicit
assistance. As I was in the Assembly, knew its temper, and was
Mr. Quincy's countryman,<a name="FNanchor_160_161" id="FNanchor_160_161"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_160_161" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> he applied to me for my influence
and assistance. I dictated his address to them, which was well
received. They voted an aid of ten thousand pounds, to be laid
out in provisions; but the governor refusing his assent to their
bill (which included this with other sums granted for the use of
the Crown), unless a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary
estate<a name="FNanchor_161_162" id="FNanchor_161_162"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_161_162" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> from bearing
    any part of the tax that would be necessary,
the Assembly, though very desirous of making their grant
to New England effectual, were at a loss how to accomplish it.
Mr. Quincy labored hard with the governor to obtain his assent,
but he was obstinate.</p>

<p>I then suggested a method of doing the business without the
governor, by orders on the trustees of the Loan Office,
    <a name="FNanchor_162_163" id="FNanchor_162_163"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_162_163" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> which,
by law, the Assembly had the right of drawing. There was, indeed,
little or no money at that time in the office, and therefore
I proposed that the orders should be payable in a year, and to
bear an interest of five per cent. With these orders I supposed
the provisions might easily be purchased. The Assembly, with
very little hesitation, adopted the proposal. The orders were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
immediately printed, and I was one of the committee directed to
sign and dispose of them. The fund for paying them was the
interest of all the paper currency then extant in the province upon
loan, together with the revenue arising from the excise,
    <a name="FNanchor_163_164" id="FNanchor_163_164"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_163_164" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> which
being known to be more than sufficient, they obtained instant
credit, and were not only received in payment for the provisions,
but many moneyed people who had cash lying by them invested
it in those orders, which they found advantageous, as they bore
interest while upon hand and might on any occasion be used as
money; so that they were eagerly all bought up, and in a few
weeks none of them were to be seen. Thus this important affair
was by my means completed. Mr. Quincy returned thanks to
the Assembly in a handsome memorial, went home highly pleased
with the success of his embassy, and ever after bore for me the
most cordial and affecting friendship.</p>

<p>The British government, not choosing to permit the union of
the colonies as proposed at Albany, and to trust that union with
their defense, lest they should thereby grow too military and feel
their own strength, suspicions and jealousies at this time being
entertained of them, sent over General Braddock with two regiments
of regular English troops for that purpose. He landed at
Alexandria, in Virginia, and thence marched to Fredericktown, in
Maryland, where he halted for carriages.<a name="FNanchor_164_165" id="FNanchor_164_165"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_164_165" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Our Assembly, apprehending
from some information that he had conceived violent
prejudices against them as averse to the service, wished me to
wait upon him, not as from them, but as postmaster-general,
under the guise of proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting
with most celerity and certainty the dispatches between
him and the governors of the several provinces, with whom he
must necessarily have continual correspondence, and of which
they proposed to pay the expense. My son accompanied me on
this journey.</p>

<p>We found the general at Fredericktown, waiting impatiently for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the return of those he had sent through the back parts of Maryland
and Virginia to collect wagons. I stayed with him several
days, dined with him daily, and had full opportunity of removing
all his prejudices by the information of what the Assembly had
before his arrival actually done, and were still willing to do, to
facilitate his operations. When I was about to depart, the returns
of wagons to be obtained were brought in, by which it appeared
that they amounted only to twenty-five, and not all of those were
in serviceable condition. The general and all the officers were
surprised, declared the expedition was then at an end, being impossible,
and exclaimed against the ministers<a name="FNanchor_165_166" id="FNanchor_165_166"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_165_166" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> for ignorantly
landing them in a country destitute of the means of conveying
their stores, baggage, etc., not less than one hundred and fifty
wagons being necessary.</p>

<p>I happened to say I thought it was pity they had not been
landed rather in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost every
farmer had his wagon. The general eagerly laid hold of my
words, and said: "Then you, sir, who are a man of interest there,
can probably procure them for us, and I beg you will undertake
it." I asked what terms were to be offered the owners of the
wagons, and I was desired to put on paper the terms that appeared
to me necessary. This I did, and they were agreed to,
and a commission and instructions accordingly prepared immediately.
What those terms were will appear in the advertisement
I published as soon as I arrived at Lancaster, which being, from
the great and sudden effect it produced, a piece of some curiosity,
I shall insert it at length as follows:</p>

<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Lancaster</span>, April 26, 1755.
</div>

<p>Whereas, one hundred and fifty wagons, with four horses to each wagon,
and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses, are wanted for the service of his
Majesty's forces now about to rendezvous at Will's Creek, and his Excellency,
General Braddock, having been pleased to empower me to contract for the
hire of the same, I hereby give notice that I shall attend for that purpose at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Lancaster from this day to next Wednesday evening, and at York from next
Thursday morning till Friday evening, where I shall be ready to agree for
wagons and teams, or single horses, on the following terms, viz.: 1. That
there shall be paid for each wagon, with four good horses and a driver, fifteen
shillings per diem;<a name="FNanchor_166_167" id="FNanchor_166_167"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_166_167" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and for each able horse
    with a pack saddle, or other saddle
and furniture, two shillings per diem; and for each able horse without a
saddle, eighteenpence per diem. 2. That the pay commence from the time
of their joining the forces at Will's Creek, which must be on or before the
20th of May ensuing, and that a reasonable allowance be paid over and above
for the time necessary for their traveling to Will's Creek and home again after
their discharge. 3. Each wagon and team, and every saddle or pack horse,
is to be valued by indifferent<a name="FNanchor_167_168" id="FNanchor_167_168"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_167_168" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> persons chosen between me and the owner; and
in case of the loss of any wagon, team, or other horse in the service, the price
according to such valuation is to be allowed and paid. 4. Seven days' pay is
to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the owner of each wagon and team,
or horse, at the time of contracting, if required, and the remainder to be paid
by General Braddock, or by the paymaster of the army, at the time of their
discharge, or from time to time, as it shall be demanded. 5. No drivers of
wagons, or persons taking care of the hired horses, are on any account to be
called upon to do the duty of soldiers, or be otherwise employed than in conducting
or taking care of their carriages or horses. 6. All oats, Indian corn,
or other forage that wagons or horses bring to the camp, more than is necessary
for the subsistence of the horses, is to be taken for the use of the army,
and a reasonable price paid for the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;My son, William Franklin, is empowered to enter into like contracts

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">To the Inhabitants of the Counties of Lancaster, York, and<br />
Cumberland.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friends and Countrymen</span>: Being occasionally at the camp at Frederick,
a few days since, I found the general and officers extremely exasperated on account
of their not being supplied with horses and carriages, which had been
expected from this province, as most able to furnish them; but, through the
dissensions between our governor and Assembly, money had not been provided,
nor any steps taken for that purpose.</p>

<p>It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties, to
seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted, and compel
as many persons into the service as would be necessary to drive and take
care of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
    I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through these counties
on such an occasion, especially considering the temper they are in, and their
resentment against us, would be attended with many and great inconveniences
to the inhabitants, and therefore more willingly took the trouble of trying first
what might be done by fair and equitable means. The people of these back
counties have lately complained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency was
wanting. You have an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a
very considerable sum; for, if the service of this expedition should continue,
as it is more than probable it will, for one hundred and twenty days, the hire
of these wagons and horses will amount to upward of thirty thousand pounds,
which will be paid you in silver and gold of the king's money.</p>

<p>The service will be light and easy, for the army will scarce march above
twelve miles per day, and the wagons and baggage horses, as they carry those
things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare of the army, must march
with the army, and no faster; and are, for the army's sake, always placed
where they can be most secure, whether in a march or in a camp.</p>

<p>If you are really, as I believe you are, good and loyal subjects to his Majesty,
you may now do a most acceptable service, and make it easy to yourselves;
for three or four of such as cannot separately spare from the business of their
plantations a wagon and four horses and a driver, may do it together, one
furnishing the wagon, another, one or two horses, and another, the driver,
and divide the pay proportionately between you; but if you do not this service
to your king and country voluntarily, when such good pay and reasonable
terms are offered to you, your loyalty will be strongly suspected. The king's
business must be done; so many brave troops, come so far for your defense,
must not stand idle through your backwardness to do what may be reasonably
expected from you; wagons and horses must be had; violent measures will
probably be used, and you will be left to seek for a recompense where you can
find it, and your case, perhaps, be little pitied or regarded.</p>

<p>I have no particular interest in this affair, as, except the satisfaction of endeavoring
to do good, I shall have only my labor for my pains. If this
method of obtaining the wagons and horses is not likely to succeed, I am
obliged to send word to the general in fourteen days; and I suppose Sir John
St. Clair, the hussar,<a name="FNanchor_168_169" id="FNanchor_168_169"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_168_169" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> with a body of soldiers, will immediately enter the
province for the purpose, which I shall be sorry to hear, because I am very
sincerely and truly your friend and wellwisher,</p>

<div class="signature">
<span class="smcap">B. Franklin.</span>
</div></div>

<p>I received of the general about eight hundred pounds, to be
disbursed in advance money to the wagon owners, etc.; but that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
sum being insufficient, I advanced upward of two hundred pounds
more, and in two weeks the one hundred and fifty wagons, with
two hundred and fifty-nine carrying horses,<a name="FNanchor_169_170" id="FNanchor_169_170"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_169_170" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> were on their march
for the camp. The advertisement promised payment according
to the valuation, in case any wagon or horse should be lost. The
owners, however, alleging they did not know General Braddock,
or what dependence might be had on his promise, insisted on my
bond for the performance, which I accordingly gave them.</p>

<p>While I was at the camp supping one evening with the officers
of Colonel Dunbar's regiment, he represented to me his concern
for the subalterns,<a name="FNanchor_170_171" id="FNanchor_170_171"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_170_171" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> who, he said, were generally not in affluence,
and could ill afford, in this dear country, to lay in the stores that
might be necessary in so long a march through a wilderness,
where nothing was to be purchased. I commiserated their case,
and resolved to endeavor procuring them some relief. I said
nothing, however, to him of my intention, but wrote the next
morning to the committee of the Assembly who had the disposition
of some public money, warmly recommending the case of
these officers to their consideration, and proposing that a present
should be sent them of necessaries and refreshments. My son,
who had some experience of a camp life and of its wants, drew
up a list for me, which I inclosed in my letter. The committee
approved, and used such diligence that, conducted by my son, the
stores arrived at the camp as soon as the wagons. They consisted
of twenty parcels, each containing</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>6 lbs. loaf sugar,<br />
6 lbs. good Muscovado<a name="FNanchor_171_172" id="FNanchor_171_172"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_171_172" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> do.,<br />
1 lb. good green tea,<br />
1 lb. good bohea do.,<br />
6 lbs. good ground coffee,<br />
6 lbs. chocolate,<br />
&frac12; cwt. best white biscuit,<br />
&frac12; lb. pepper,<br />
1 quart best white wine vinegar,<br />
1 Gloucester cheese,<br />
1 keg containing 20 lbs. good butter,<br />
2 doz. old Madeira wine,<br />
2 gals. Jamaica spirits,<br />
1 bottle flour of mustard,<br />
2 well-cured hams,<br />
&frac12; doz. dried tongues,<br />
6 lbs. rice,<br />
6 lbs. raisins.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
    These twenty parcels, well packed, were placed on as many
horses, each parcel, with the horse, being intended as a present
for one officer. They were very thankfully received, and the kindness
acknowledged by letters to me from the colonels of both
regiments in the most grateful terms. The general, too, was
highly satisfied with my conduct in procuring him the wagons,
etc., and readily paid my account of disbursements, thanking me
repeatedly, and requesting my further assistance in sending provisions
after him. I undertook this also, and was busily employed
in it till we heard of his defeat, advancing for the service, of my
own money, upward of one thousand pounds sterling, of which I
sent him an account. It came to his hands, luckily for me, a few
days before the battle, and he returned me immediately an order
on the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds,
leaving the remainder to the next account. I consider this payment
as good luck, having never been able to obtain that remainder,
of which more hereafter.</p>

<p>This general was, I think, a brave man, and might probably
have made a figure as a good officer in some European war.
But he had too much self-confidence, too high an opinion of the
validity of regular troops, and too mean a one of both Americans
and Indians. George Croghan, our Indian interpreter, joined him
on his march with one hundred of those people, who might have
been of great use to his army as guides, scouts, etc., if he had
treated them kindly; but he slighted and neglected them, and
they gradually left him.</p>

<p>In conversation with him one day he was giving me some account
of his intended progress. "After taking Fort Duquesne,"
    <a name="FNanchor_172_173" id="FNanchor_172_173"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_172_173" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
says he, "I am to proceed to Niagara; and, having taken that,
to Frontenac, if the season will allow time, and I suppose it will,
for Duquesne can hardly detain me above three or four days;
and then I see nothing that can obstruct my march to Niagara."
Having before revolved in my mind the long line his army must
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
make in their march by a very narrow road, to be cut for them
through the woods and bushes, and also what I had read of a
former defeat of fifteen hundred French, who invaded the Iroquois
country, I had conceived some doubts and some fears for the
event of the campaign. But I ventured only to say: "To be
sure, sir, if you arrive well before Duquesne with these fine troops,
so well provided with artillery, that place, not yet completely
fortified, and, as we hear, with no very strong garrison, can
probably make but a short resistance. The only danger I apprehend
of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of Indians,
who, by constant practice, are dexterous in laying and executing
them; and the slender line, near four miles long, which your army
must make, may expose it to be attacked by surprise in its flanks,
and to be cut like a thread into several pieces, which, from their
distance, cannot come up in time to support each other."</p>

<p>He smiled at my ignorance, and replied: "These savages may,
indeed, be a formidable enemy to your raw American militia, but
upon the king's regular and disciplined troops, sir, it is impossible
they should make any impression." I was conscious of an impropriety
in my disputing with a military man in matters of his
profession, and said no more. The enemy, however, did not take
the advantage of his army which I apprehended its long line of
march exposed it to, but let it advance without interruption till
within nine miles of the place; and then, when more in a body
(for it had just passed a river where the front had halted till all
had come over), and in a more open part of the woods than any
it had passed, attacked its advance guard by a heavy fire from
behind trees and bushes, which was the first intelligence the general
had of an enemy's being near him. This guard being disordered,
the general hurried the troops up to their assistance,
which was done in great confusion, through wagons, baggage, and
cattle; and presently the fire came upon their flank. The officers,
being on horseback, were more easily distinguished, picked out as
marks, and fell very fast; and the soldiers were crowded together
in a huddle, having or hearing no orders, and standing to be shot
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
at till two thirds of them were killed; and then, being seized with
a panic, the whole fled with precipitation.</p>

<p>The wagoners took each a horse out of his team, and scampered;
their example was immediately followed by others, so that
all the wagons, provisions, artillery, and stores were left to the
enemy. The general, being wounded, was brought off with difficulty;
his secretary, Mr. Shirley, was killed by his side; and out
of eighty-six officers, sixty-three were killed or wounded, and seven
hundred and fourteen men killed out of eleven hundred. These
eleven hundred had been picked men from the whole army; the
rest had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar, who was to follow
with the heavier part of the stores, provisions, and baggage. The
flyers, not being pursued, arrived at Dunbar's camp, and the panic
they brought with them instantly seized him and all his people;
and though he had now above one thousand men, and the enemy
who had beaten Braddock did not at most exceed four hundred
Indians and French together, instead of proceeding and endeavoring
to recover some of the lost honor, he ordered all the stores,
ammunition, etc., to be destroyed, that he might have more horses
to assist his flight toward the settlements and less lumber to remove.
He was there met with requests from the governors of
Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, that he would post his
troops on the frontiers so as to afford some protection to the inhabitants;
but he continued his hasty march through all the
country, not thinking himself safe till he arrived at Philadelphia,
where the inhabitants could protect him. This whole transaction
gave us Americans the first suspicion that our exalted ideas of the
prowess of British regulars had not been well founded.</p>

<p>In their first march, too, from their landing till they got beyond
the settlements, they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants,
totally ruining some poor families, besides insulting, abusing, and
confining the people if they remonstrated. This was enough to
put us out of conceit of such defenders, if we had really wanted
any. How different was the conduct of our French friends in
1781, who, during a march through the most inhabited part of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
our country from Rhode Island to Virginia, near seven hundred
miles, occasioned not the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig,
a chicken, or even an apple.</p>

<p>Captain Orme, who was one of the general's aids-de-camp,
and, being grievously wounded, was brought off with him and
continued with him to his death, which happened in a few days,
told me that he was totally silent all the first day, and at night
only said: "Who would have thought it?" that he was silent
again the following day, saying only at last: "We shall better
know how to deal with them another time," and died in a few
minutes after.</p>

<p>The secretary's papers, with all the general's orders, instructions,
and correspondence, falling into the enemy's hands, they
selected and translated into French a number of the articles,
which they printed, to prove the hostile intentions of the British
court before the declaration of war. Among these I saw some
letters of the general to the ministry, speaking highly of the great
service I had rendered the army, and recommending me to their
notice. David Hume,<a name="FNanchor_173_174" id="FNanchor_173_174"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_173_174" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> too, who was some years after secretary
to Lord Hertford when minister in France, and afterward to
General Conway when secretary of state, told me he had seen,
among the papers in that office, letters from Braddock highly
recommending me. But, the expedition having been unfortunate,
my service, it seems, was not thought of much value, for
those recommendations were never of any use to me.</p>

<p>As to rewards from himself, I asked only one, which was that
he would give orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our
bought servants,<a name="FNanchor_174_175" id="FNanchor_174_175"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_174_175" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and that he would discharge such as had been
already enlisted. This he readily granted, and several were accordingly
returned to their masters on my application. Dunbar,
when the command devolved on him, was not so generous. He
being at Philadelphia, on his retreat, or rather flight, I applied
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
to him for the discharge of the servants of three poor farmers
of Lancaster County that he had enlisted, reminding him of the
late general's orders on that head. He promised me that, if the
masters would come to him at Trenton, where he should be in a
few days on his march to New York, he would there deliver
their men to them. They accordingly were at the expense and
trouble of going to Trenton, and there he refused to perform his
promise, to their great loss and disappointment.</p>

<p>As soon as the loss of the wagons and horses was generally
known, all the owners came upon me for the valuation which I
had given bond to pay. Their demands gave me a great deal of
trouble. My acquainting them that the money was ready in the
paymaster's hands, but that orders for paying it must first be obtained
from General Shirley, and my assuring them that I had
applied to that general by letter, but, he being at a distance, an answer
could not soon be received, and they must have patience,&mdash;all
this was not sufficient to satisfy, and some began to sue me.
General Shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation
by appointing commissioners to examine the claims, and ordering
payment. They amounted to near twenty thousand pounds,
which to pay would have ruined me.</p>

<p>Before we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors Bond
came to me with a subscription paper for raising money to defray
the expense of a grand firework, which it was intended to
exhibit at a rejoicing on receipt of the news of our taking Fort
Duquesne. I looked grave, and said it would, I thought, be
time enough to prepare for the rejoicing when we knew we
should have occasion to rejoice. They seemed surprised that I
did not immediately comply with their proposal. "Why," says
one of them, "you surely don't suppose that the fort will not be
taken?" "I don't know that it will not be taken, but I know
that the events of war are subject to great uncertainty." I gave
them the reasons of my doubting; the subscription was dropped,
and the projectors thereby missed the mortification they would
have undergone if the firework had been prepared. Dr. Bond,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
on some other occasion afterward, said that he did not like
Franklin's forebodings.</p>

<p>Governor Morris, who had continually worried the Assembly
with message after message, before the defeat of Braddock, to
beat them into the making of acts to raise money for the defense
of the province without taxing, among others, the proprietary
estates, and had rejected all their bills for not having such an
exempting clause, now redoubled his attacks with more hope of
success, the danger and necessity being greater. The Assembly,
however, continued firm, believing they had justice on their side,
and that it would be giving up an essential right if they suffered
the governor to amend their money bills. In one of the last,
indeed, which was for granting fifty thousand pounds, his proposed
amendment was only of a single word. The bill expressed
that all estates, real and personal, were to be taxed, those of the
proprietaries not excepted. His amendment was, "for <i>not</i> read
<i>only</i>"&mdash;a small, but very material, alteration.</p>

<p>However, when the news of this disaster reached England, our
friends there, whom we had taken care to furnish with all the
Assembly's answers to the governor's messages, raised a clamor
against the proprietaries for their meanness and injustice in giving
their governor such instructions; some going so far as to say that,
by obstructing the defense of their province, they forfeited their
right to it. They were intimidated by this, and sent orders to their
receiver-general to add five thousand pounds of their money to
whatever sum might be given by the Assembly for such purpose.</p>

<p>This, being notified to the House, was accepted in lieu of their
share of a general tax, and a new bill was formed, with an exempting
clause, which passed accordingly. By this act I was
appointed one of the commissioners for disposing of the money,&mdash;sixty
thousand pounds. I had been active in modeling the bill
and procuring its passage, and had, at the same time, drawn a
bill for establishing and disciplining a voluntary militia, which I
carried through the House without much difficulty, as care was
taken in it to leave the Quakers at their liberty. To promote
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the association necessary to form the militia, I wrote a dialogue,
    <a name="FNanchor_175_176" id="FNanchor_175_176"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_175_176" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
stating and answering all the objections I could think of to such
a militia, which was printed, and had, as I thought, great effect.</p>

<p>While the several companies in the city and country were
forming, and learning their exercise, the governor prevailed with
me to take charge of our northwestern frontier, which was infested
by the enemy, and provide for the defense of the inhabitants
by raising troops and building a line of forts. I undertook
this military business, though I did not conceive myself well
qualified for it. He gave me a commission with full powers,
and a parcel of blank commissions for officers, to be given to
whom I thought fit. I had but little difficulty in raising men,
having soon five hundred and sixty under my command. My
son, who had in the preceding war been an officer in the army
raised against Canada, was my aid-de-camp, and of great use to
me. The Indians had burned Gnadenhut, a village settled by
the Moravians, and massacred the inhabitants; but the place was
thought a good situation for one of the forts.</p>

<p>In order to march thither, I assembled the companies at Bethlehem,
    <a name="FNanchor_176_177" id="FNanchor_176_177"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_176_177" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
the chief establishment of those people. I was surprised
to find it in so good a posture of defense; the destruction of
Gnadenhut had made them apprehend danger. The principal
buildings were defended by a stockade, they had purchased a
quantity of arms and ammunition from New York, and had even
placed quantities of small paving stones between the windows of
their high stone houses, for their women to throw down upon the
heads of any Indians that should attempt to force into them.
The armed brethren, too, kept watch, and relieved
    <a name="FNanchor_177_178" id="FNanchor_177_178"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_177_178" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> as methodically
as in any garrison town. In conversation with the bishop,
Spangenberg, I mentioned this my surprise; for, knowing they
had obtained an act of Parliament exempting them from military
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
duties in the colonies, I had supposed they were conscientiously
scrupulous of bearing arms. He answered me that it was not
one of their established principles, but that, at the time of their
obtaining that act, it was thought to be a principle with many of
their people. On this occasion, however, they, to their surprise,
found it adopted by but a few. It seems they were either deceived
in themselves or deceived the Parliament; but common
sense, aided by present danger, will sometimes be too strong for
whimsical opinions.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of January when we set out upon this
business of building forts. I sent one detachment toward the
Minisink,<a name="FNanchor_178_179" id="FNanchor_178_179"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_178_179" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> with instructions
    to erect one for the security of that
upper part of the country, and another to the lower part, with
similar instructions; and I concluded to go myself with the rest
of my force to Gnadenhut, where a fort was thought more immediately
necessary. The Moravians procured me five wagons
for our tools, stores, baggage, etc.</p>

<p>Just before we left Bethlehem, eleven farmers, who had been
driven from their plantations by the Indians, came to me requesting
a supply of firearms, that they might go back and fetch off
their cattle. I gave them each a gun with suitable ammunition.
We had not marched many miles before it began to rain, and it
continued raining all day. There were no habitations on the road
to shelter us till we arrived, near night, at the house of a German,
where, and in his barn, we were all huddled together, as wet as
water could make us. It was well we were not attacked in our
march, for our arms were of the most ordinary sort, and our men
could not keep their gunlocks dry. The Indians are dexterous
in contrivances for that purpose, which we had not. They met
that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned, and killed ten
of them. The one who escaped informed us that his and his companions'
guns would not go off, the priming<a name="FNanchor_179_180" id="FNanchor_179_180"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_179_180" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> being wet with the rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
    The next day being fair, we continued our march, and arrived
at the desolated Gnadenhut. There was a sawmill near, round
which were left several piles of boards, with which we soon hutted
ourselves,&mdash;an operation the more necessary at that inclement
season as we had no tents. Our first work was to bury more
effectually the dead we found there, who had been half interred
by the country people.</p>

<p>The next morning our fort was planned and marked out, the
circumference measuring four hundred and fifty-five feet, which
would require as many palisades to be made of trees, one with
another, of a foot diameter each. Our axes, of which we had
seventy, were immediately set to work to cut down trees, and,
our men being dexterous in the use of them, great dispatch was
made. Seeing the trees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to look
at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine; in six
minutes they had it upon the ground, and I found it of fourteen
inches' diameter. Each pine made three palisades of eighteen
feet long, pointed at one end. While these were preparing, our
other men dug a trench all round, of three feet deep, in which
the palisades were to be planted; and our wagons, the bodies
being taken off, and the fore and hind wheels separated by taking
out the pin which united the two parts of the perch,
    <a name="FNanchor_180_181" id="FNanchor_180_181"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_180_181" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> we had ten
carriages, with two horses each, to bring the palisades from the
woods to the spot. When they were set up, our carpenters built
a stage of boards all round within, about six feet high, for the
men to stand on when to fire through the loopholes. We had
one swivel gun,<a name="FNanchor_181_182" id="FNanchor_181_182"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_181_182" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> which we mounted on one of the angles, and
fired it as soon as fixed, to let the Indians know, if any were
within hearing, that we had such pieces; and thus our fort, if
such a magnificent name may be given to so miserable a stockade,
was finished in a week, though it rained so hard every other
day that the men could not work.</p>

<p>This gave me occasion to observe that, when men are employed,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
they are best contented; for on the days they worked
they were good-natured and cheerful, and, with the consciousness
of having done a good day's work, they spent the evening
jollily; but on our idle days they were mutinous and quarrelsome,
finding fault with their pork, the bread, etc., and in continual
ill humor, which put me in mind of a sea captain, whose
rule it was to keep his men constantly at work; and, when his
mate once told him that they had done everything, and there
was nothing further to employ them about, "Oh," says he, "make
them scour the anchor."</p>

<p>This kind of fort, however contemptible, is a sufficient defense
against Indians, who have no cannon. Finding ourselves now
posted securely, and having a place to retreat to on occasion, we
ventured out in parties to scour the adjacent country. We met
with no Indians, but we found the places on the neighboring
hills where they had lain to watch our proceedings. There was
an art in their contrivance of those places that seems worth mention.
It being winter, a fire was necessary for them; but a common
fire on the surface of the ground would, by its light, have
discovered their position at a distance. They had therefore dug
holes in the ground about three feet in diameter, and somewhat
deeper. We saw where they had with their hatchets cut off the
charcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods. With
these coals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes,
and we observed among the weeds and grass the prints of their
bodies, made by their lying all round, with their legs hanging
down in the holes to keep their feet warm, which, with them, is
an essential point. This kind of fire, so managed, could not
discover them, either by its light, flame, sparks, or even smoke.
It appeared that their number was not great, and it seems they
saw we were too many to be attacked by them with prospect of
advantage.</p>

<p>We had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister, Mr.
Beatty, who complained to me that the men did not generally
attend his prayers and exhortations. When they enlisted, they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
<a name="were" id="were"></a>were promised, besides pay and provisions, a gill of rum a day,
which was punctually served out to them, half in the morning,
and the other half in the evening, and I observed they were as
punctual in attending to receive it; upon which I said to Mr.
Beatty: "It is, perhaps, below the dignity of your profession to
act as steward of the rum, but if you were to deal it out, and
only just after prayers, you would have them all about you."
He liked the thought, undertook the office, and, with the help of
a few hands to measure out the liquor, executed it to satisfaction,
and never were prayers more generally and more punctually
attended; so that I thought this method preferable to the punishment
inflicted by some military laws for nonattendance on
divine service.</p>

<p>I had hardly finished this business, and got my fort well stored
with provisions, when I received a letter from the governor,
acquainting me that he had called the Assembly, and wished my
attendance there if the posture of affairs on the frontiers was
such that my remaining there was no longer necessary. My
friends, too, of the Assembly, pressing me by their letters to be,
if possible, at the meeting, and my three intended forts being now
completed, and the inhabitants contented to remain on their
farms under that protection, I resolved to return; the more willingly,
as a New England officer, Colonel Clapham, experienced
in Indian war, being on a visit to our establishment, consented
to accept the command. I gave him a commission, and, parading
the garrison, had it read before them, and introduced him
to them as an officer who, from his skill in military affairs, was
much more fit to command them than myself; and, giving them
a little exhortation, took my leave. I was escorted as far as
Bethlehem, where I rested a few days to recover from the fatigue
I had undergone. The first night, being in a good bed, I could
hardly sleep, it was so different from my hard lodging on the
floor of our hut at Gnaden, wrapped only in a blanket or two.</p>

<p>While at Bethlehem, I inquired a little into the practice of the
Moravians; some of them had accompanied me, and all were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
very kind to me. I found they worked for a common stock,
    <a name="FNanchor_182_183" id="FNanchor_182_183"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_182_183" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
ate at common tables, and slept in common dormitories, great
numbers together. In the dormitories I observed loopholes, at
certain distances all along just under the ceiling, which I thought
judiciously placed for change of air. I was at their church,
where I was entertained with good music, the organ being accompanied
with violins, hautboys, flutes, clarinets, etc. I understood
that their sermons were not usually preached to mixed congregations
of men, women, and children, as is our common practice,
but that they assembled sometimes the married men, at other
times their wives, then the young men, the young women, and
the little children, each division by itself. The sermon I heard
was to the latter, who came in and were placed in rows on
benches; the boys under the conduct of a young man, their
tutor, and the girls conducted by a young woman. The discourse
seemed well adapted to their capacities, and was delivered
in a pleasing, familiar manner, coaxing them, as it were, to be
good. They behaved very orderly, but looked pale and unhealthy,
which made me suspect they were kept too much within
doors, or not allowed sufficient exercise.</p>

<p>I inquired concerning the Moravian marriages, whether the
report was true that they were by lot. I was told that lots were
used only in particular cases; that generally, when a young man
found himself disposed to marry, he informed the elders of his
class, who consulted the elder ladies that governed the young
women. As these elders of the different sexes were well acquainted
with the tempers and dispositions of their respective
pupils, they could best judge what matches were suitable, and
their judgments were generally acquiesced in; but if, for example,
it should happen that two or three young women were found
to be equally proper for the young man, the lot was then recurred
to. I objected, if the matches are not made by the mutual
choice of the parties, some of them may chance to be very unhappy.
"And so they may," answered my informer, "if you let
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the parties choose for themselves;" which, indeed, I could not
deny.</p>

<p>Being returned to Philadelphia, I found the association went
on swimmingly, the inhabitants that were not Quakers having
pretty generally come into it, formed themselves into companies,
and chosen their captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, according to
the new law. Dr. B. visited me, and gave me an account of the
pains he had taken to spread a general good liking to the law,
and ascribed much to those endeavors. I had had the vanity to
ascribe all to my "Dialogue;" however, not knowing but that he
might be in the right, I let him enjoy his opinion, which I take
to be generally the best way in such cases. The officers, meeting,
chose me to be colonel of the regiment, which I this time
accepted. I forget how many companies we had, but we paraded
about twelve hundred well-looking men, with a company of artillery,
who had been furnished with six brass fieldpieces,
    <a name="FNanchor_183_184" id="FNanchor_183_184"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_183_184" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> which
they had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve times
in a minute. The first time I reviewed my regiment they accompanied
me to my house, and would salute me with some rounds
fired before my door, which shook down and broke several glasses
of my electrical apparatus. And my new honor proved not
much less brittle; for all our commissions were soon after broken
by a repeal of the law in England.</p>

<p>During this short time of my colonelship, being about to set
out on a journey to Virginia, the officers of my regiment took it
into their heads that it would be proper for them to escort me
out of town, as far as the Lower Ferry. Just as I was getting
on horseback they came to my door, between thirty and forty,
mounted, and all in their uniforms. I had not been previously
acquainted with the project, or I should have prevented it, being
naturally averse to the assuming of state on any occasion; and
I was a good deal chagrined at their appearance, as I could not
avoid their accompanying me. What made it worse was that
as soon as we began to move, they drew their swords and rode
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
with them naked all the way. Somebody wrote an account of
this to the proprietor, and it gave him great offense. No such
honor had been paid him when in the province, nor to any of his
governors, and he said it was only proper to princes of the blood
royal; which may be true for aught I know, who was, and still
am, ignorant of the etiquette in such cases.</p>

<p>This silly affair, however, greatly increased his rancor against
me, which was before not a little on account of my conduct in
the Assembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation,
which I had always opposed very warmly, and not without
severe reflections on his meanness and injustice of contending for
it. He accused me to the ministry as being the great obstacle
to the king's service, preventing, by my influence in the House,
the proper form of the bills for raising money; and he instanced
this parade with my officers as a proof of my having an intention
to take the government of the province out of his hands by force.
He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener, the postmaster-general,
to deprive me of my office; but it had no other effect than to
procure from Sir Everard a gentle admonition.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor
and the House, in which I, as a member, had so large a share,
there still subsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman
and myself, and we never had any personal difference. I have
sometimes since thought that his little or no resentment against
me for the answers it was known I drew up to his messages,
might be the effect of professional habit, and that, being bred a
lawyer, he might consider us both as merely advocates for contending
clients in a suit, he for the proprietaries and I for the
Assembly. He would, therefore, sometimes call in a friendly
way to advise with me on difficult points, and sometimes, though
not often, take my advice.</p>

<p>We acted in concert to supply Braddock's army with provisions;
and when the shocking news arrived of his defeat, the
governor sent in haste for me to consult with him on measures
for preventing the desertion of the back counties. I forget now
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the advice I gave; but I think it was that Dunbar should be
written to, and prevailed with, if possible, to post his troops on
the frontiers for their protection, till, by reënforcements from the
colonies, he might be able to proceed on the expedition. And,
after my return from the frontier, he would have had me undertake
the conduct of such an expedition with provincial troops,
for the reduction of Fort Duquesne, Dunbar and his men being
otherwise employed; and he proposed to commission me as
general. I had not so good an opinion of my military abilities
as he professed to have, and I believe his professions must have
exceeded his real sentiments; but probably he might think that
my popularity would facilitate the raising of the men, and my
influence in Assembly, the grant of money to pay them, and that,
perhaps, without taxing the proprietary estate. Finding me not
so forward to engage as he expected, the project was dropped,
and he soon after left the government, being superseded by Captain
Denny.</p>

<p>Before I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs
under this new governor's administration, it may not be amiss
here to give some account of the rise and progress of my philosophical
reputation.</p>

<h2>§ 9. THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENTS.</h2>

<p>In 1746, being at Boston, I met there with a Dr. Spence, who
was lately arrived from Scotland, and showed me some electric
experiments. They were imperfectly performed, as he was
not very expert; but, being on a subject quite new to me, they
equally surprised and pleased me. Soon after my return to Philadelphia,
our library company received from Mr. Collinson,
Fellow of the Royal Society of London, a present of a glass tube,
with some account of the use of it in making such experiments.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
I eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what I had seen at
Boston; and, by much practice, acquired great readiness in performing
those, also, which we had an account of from England,
adding a number of new ones. I say much practice, for my
house was continually full, for some time, with people who came
to see these new wonders.</p>

<p>To divide a little this incumbrance among my friends, I caused
a number of similar tubes to be blown at our glasshouse, with
which they furnished themselves, so that we had at length several
performers. Among these, the principal was Mr. Kinnersley, an
ingenious neighbor, who, being out of business, I encouraged to
undertake showing the experiments for money, and drew up for
him two lectures, in which the experiments were ranged in such
order, and accompanied with such explanations in such method,
as that the foregoing should assist in comprehending the following.
He procured an elegant apparatus for the purpose, in which
all the little machines that I had roughly made for myself were
nicely formed by instrument makers. His lectures were well
attended, and gave great satisfaction; and after some time he
went through the colonies, exhibiting them in every capital town,
and picked up some money. In the West India islands, indeed,
it was with difficulty the experiments could be made, from the
general moisture of the air.</p>

<p>Obliged as we were to Mr. Collinson for his present of the
tube, etc., I thought it right he should be informed of our success
in using it, and wrote him several letters containing accounts
of our experiments. He got them read in the Royal Society,
where they were not at first thought worth so much notice as to
be printed in their "Transactions." One paper, which I wrote
for Mr. Kinnersley, on the sameness of lightning with electricity,
I sent to Dr. Mitchel, an acquaintance of mine, and one of the
members also of that society, who wrote me word that it had
been read, but was laughed at by the connoisseurs. The papers,
however, being shown to Dr. Fothergill, he thought them of too
much value to be stifled, and advised the printing of them. Mr.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Collinson then gave them to Cave<a name="FNanchor_184_185" id="FNanchor_184_185"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_184_185" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> for publication in his "Gentleman's
Magazine;" but he chose to print them separately in a
pamphlet, and Dr. Fothergill wrote the preface. Cave, it seems,
judged rightly for his profit, for, by the additions that arrived
afterward, they swelled to a quarto volume, which has had five
editions, and cost him nothing for copy money.<a name="FNanchor_185_186" id="FNanchor_185_186"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_185_186" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>It was, however, some time before those papers were much
taken notice of in England. A copy of them happening to fall
into the hands of the Count de Buffon, a philosopher deservedly
of great reputation in France, and, indeed, all over Europe, he
prevailed with M.<a name="FNanchor_186_187" id="FNanchor_186_187"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_186_187" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Dalibard to translate them into French, and
they were printed at Paris. The publication offended the Abbé
    <a name="FNanchor_187_188" id="FNanchor_187_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_188" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
Nollet, preceptor in natural philosophy to the royal family and
an able experimenter, who had formed and published a theory
of electricity which then had the general vogue. He could not
at first believe that such a work came from America, and said it
must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry his
system. Afterward, having been assured that there really existed
such a person as Franklin at Philadelphia, which he had doubted,
he wrote and published a volume of "Letters," chiefly addressed
to me, defending his theory, and denying the verity of my experiments,
and of the positions deduced from them.</p>

<p>I once purposed answering the abbé, and actually began the
answer; but, on consideration that my writings contained a description
of experiments which any one might repeat and verify,
and if not to be verified, could not be defended; or of observations
offered as conjectures, and not delivered dogmatically,
therefore not laying me under any obligation to defend them;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
and reflecting that a dispute between two persons writing in different
languages might be lengthened greatly by mistranslations,
and thence misconceptions of one another's meaning, much of
one of the abbé's letters being founded on an error in the translation,
I concluded to let my papers shift for themselves, believing
it was better to spend what time I could spare from public business
in making new experiments, than in disputing about those
already made. I therefore never answered M. Nollet, and the
event gave me no cause to repent my silence; for my friend
M. le Roy, of the Royal Academy of Sciences, took up my cause
and refuted him, my book was translated into the Italian, German,
and Latin languages, and the doctrine it contained was by
degrees universally adopted by the philosophers of Europe, in
preference to that of the abbé; so that he lived to see himself
the last of his sect, except Monsieur B&mdash;&mdash;, of Paris, his <i>élève</i>
    <a name="FNanchor_188_189" id="FNanchor_188_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_189" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
and immediate disciple.</p>

<p>What gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity
was the success of one of its proposed experiments, made by
Messrs. Dalibard and De Lor at Marly, for drawing lightning
from the clouds. This engaged the public attention everywhere.
M. de Lor, who had an apparatus for experimental philosophy,
and lectured in that branch of science, undertook to repeat what
he called the "Philadelphia experiments," and, after they were performed
before the king and court, all the curious of Paris flocked
to see them. I will not swell this narrative with an account of
that capital experiment, nor of the infinite pleasure I received in
the success of a similar one I made soon after with a kite at Philadelphia,
as both are to be found in the histories of electricity.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright, an English physician, when at Paris, wrote to a
friend who was of the Royal Society, an account of the high
esteem my experiments<a name="FNanchor_N_22" id="FNanchor_N_22"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_22" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> were in among the learned abroad, and
of their wonder that my writings had been so little noticed in
England. The society, on this, resumed the consideration of the
letters that had been read to them; and the celebrated Dr. Watson
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
drew up a summary account of them, and of all I had afterward
sent to England on the subject, which he accompanied
with some praise of the writer. This summary was then printed
in their "Transactions;" and some members of the society in
London, particularly the very ingenious Mr. Canton, having verified
the experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a
pointed rod,<a name="FNanchor_189_190" id="FNanchor_189_190"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_189_190" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> and acquainting them with the success, they soon
made me more than amends for the slight with which they had
before treated me. Without my having made any application
for that honor, they chose me a member, and voted that I should
be excused the customary payments, which would have amounted
to twenty-five guineas, and ever since have given me their "Transactions"
gratis. They also presented me with the gold medal
of Sir Godfrey Copley for the year 1753, the delivery of which
was accompanied by a very handsome speech of the president,
Lord Macclesfield, wherein I was highly honored.</p>

<p>Our new governor, Captain Denny, brought over for me the
before-mentioned medal from the Royal Society, which he presented
to me at an entertainment given him by the city. He
accompanied it with very polite expressions of his esteem for
me, having, as he said, been long acquainted with my character.
After dinner, when the company, as was customary at that time,
were engaged in drinking, he took me aside into another room,
and acquainted me that he had been advised by his friends in
England to cultivate a friendship with me, as one who was capable
of giving him the best advice, and of contributing most effectually
to the making his administration easy; that he therefore desired
of all things to have a good understanding with me, and he
begged me to be assured of his readiness on all occasions to render
me every service that might be in his power. He said much to
me, also, of the proprietor's good disposition toward the province,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
<a name="and" id="and"></a>and of the advantage it might be to us all, and to me in particular,
if the opposition that had been so long continued to his measures
was dropped, and harmony restored between him and the
people; in effecting which it was thought no one could be more
serviceable than myself, and I might depend on adequate acknowledgments
and recompenses, etc. The drinkers, finding
we did not return immediately to the table, sent us a decanter
of Madeira, which the governor made liberal use of, and in proportion
became more profuse of his solicitations and promises.</p>

<p>My answers were to this purpose: that my circumstances,
thanks to God, were such as to make proprietary favors unnecessary
to me; and that, being a member of the Assembly, I could
not possibly accept of any; that, however, I had no personal enmity
to the proprietary, and that, whenever the public measures
he proposed should appear to be for the good of the people, no
one should espouse and forward them more zealously than myself,
my past opposition having been founded on this, that the
measures which had been urged were evidently intended to serve
the proprietary interest, with great prejudice to that of the people;
that I was much obliged to him (the governor) for his professions
of regard to me, and that he might rely on everything in
my power to make his administration as easy as possible, hoping
at the same time that he had not brought with him the same unfortunate
instructions his predecessor had been hampered with.</p>

<p>On this he did not then explain himself; but when he afterward
came to do business with the Assembly, they appeared
again, the disputes were renewed, and I was as active as ever in
the opposition, being the penman, first, of the request to have a
communication of the instructions, and then of the remarks upon
them, which may be found in the votes of the time, and in the
"Historical Review" I afterward published. But between us
personally no enmity arose; we were often together. He was a
man of letters, had seen much of the world, and was very entertaining
and pleasing in conversation. He gave me the first information
that my old friend James Ralph was still alive; that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
<a name="he" id="he"></a>he was esteemed one of the best political writers in England; had
been employed in the dispute between Prince Frederic and the
king, and had obtained a pension of three hundred a year; that
his reputation was indeed small as a poet, Pope having damned
his poetry in the "Dunciad," but his prose was thought as good
as any man's.</p>

<p>The Assembly, finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted
in manacling their deputies<a name="FNanchor_190_191" id="FNanchor_190_191"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_190_191" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> with instructions inconsistent
not only with the privileges of the people but with the service of
the Crown, resolved to petition the king against them, and appointed
me their agent to go over to England to present and support
the petition. The House had sent up a bill to the governor,
granting a sum of sixty thousand pounds for the king's use, (ten
thousand pounds of which was subjected to the orders of the
then general, Lord Loudoun,) which the governor absolutely refused
to pass, in compliance with his instructions.</p>

<h2>§ 10. MISSION TO ENGLAND.</h2>

<p>I had agreed with Captain Morris, of the packet
    <a name="FNanchor_191_192" id="FNanchor_191_192"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_191_192" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> at New
York, for my passage, and my stores were put on board, when
Lord Loudoun arrived at Philadelphia, expressly, as he told me,
to endeavor an accommodation between the governor and Assembly,
that his Majesty's service might not be obstructed by their
dissensions. Accordingly, he desired the governor and myself to
meet him, that he might hear what was to be said on both sides.
We met and discussed the business. In behalf of the Assembly,
I urged all the various arguments that may be found in the public
papers of that time, which were of my writing, and are printed
with the minutes of the Assembly; and the governor pleaded his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
instructions, the bond he had given to observe them, and his ruin
if he disobeyed, yet seemed not unwilling to hazard himself if
Lord Loudoun would advise it. This his lordship did not choose
to do, though I once thought I had nearly prevailed with him to
do it; but finally he rather chose to urge the compliance of the
Assembly, and he entreated me to use my endeavors with them
for that purpose, declaring that he would spare none of the king's
troops for the defense of our frontiers, and that, if we did not
continue to provide for that defense ourselves, they must remain
exposed to the enemy.</p>

<p>I acquainted the House with what had passed, and, presenting
them with a set of resolutions I had drawn up, declaring our
rights, and that we did not relinquish our claims to those rights,
but only suspended the exercise of them on this occasion through
force, against which we protested, they at length agreed to drop
that bill, and frame another, conformable to the proprietary instructions.
This of course the governor passed, and I was then
at liberty to proceed on my voyage. But, in the mean time, the
packet had sailed with my sea stores, which was some loss to me,
and my only recompense was his lordship's thanks for my service,
all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling to his
share.</p>

<p>He set out for New York before me; and, as the time for dispatching
the packet boats was at his disposition, and there were
two then remaining there, one of which, he said, was to sail very
soon, I requested to know the precise time, that I might not miss
her by any delay of mine. His answer was: "I have given out
that she is to sail on Saturday next; but I may let you know,
<i>entre nous</i>,<a name="FNanchor_192_193" id="FNanchor_192_193"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_192_193" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> that if you are there by Monday morning, you will
be in time, but do not delay longer." By some accidental hindrance
at a ferry, it was Monday noon before I arrived, and
I was much afraid she might have sailed, as the wind was fair;
but I was soon made easy by the information that she was still in
the harbor, and would not move till the next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
    One would imagine that I was now on the very point of
departing for Europe. I thought so; but I was not then so
well acquainted with his lordship's character, of which indecision
was one of the strongest features. I shall give some instances.
It was about the beginning of April that I came to New York,
and I think it was near the end of June before we sailed. There
were then two of the packet boats, which had been long in port,
but were detained for the general's letters, which were always
to be ready to-morrow. Another packet arrived; she too was
detained; and, before we sailed, a fourth was expected. Ours
was the first to be dispatched, as having been there longest.
Passengers were engaged in all, and some extremely impatient
to be gone, and the merchants uneasy about their letters and
the orders they had given for insurance (it being war time) for
fall goods; but their anxiety availed nothing; his lordship's letters
were not ready; and yet whoever waited on him found him
always at his desk, pen in hand, and concluded he must needs
write abundantly.</p>

<p>Going myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in his
antechamber one Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia, who had
come from thence express with a packet from Governor Denny
for the general. He delivered to me some letters from my friends
there, which occasioned my inquiry when he was to return, and
where he lodged, that I might send some letters by him. He
told me he was ordered to call to-morrow at nine for the general's
answer to the governor, and should set off immediately. I put
my letters into his hands the same day. A fortnight after I met
him again in the same place. "So, you are soon returned, Innis?"
"Returned! no, I am not gone yet." "How so?" "I
have called here by order every morning these two weeks past for
his lordship's letter, and it is not yet ready." "Is it possible,
when he is so great a writer? for I see him constantly at his
escritoire." "Yes," says Innis, "but he is like St. George on
the signs, always on horseback, and never rides on." This observation
of the messenger was, it seems, well founded; for, when
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
<a name="in" id="in"></a>in England, I understood that Mr. Pitt<a name="FNanchor_193_194" id="FNanchor_193_194"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_193_194" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> gave it as one reason
for removing this general, and sending Generals Amherst and
Wolfe, that the minister never heard from him, and could not know
what he was doing.</p>

<p>This daily expectation of sailing, and all the three packets going
down to Sandy Hook, to join the fleet there, the passengers
thought it best to be on board, lest by a sudden order the ships
should sail and they be left behind. There, if I remember right,
we were about six weeks, consuming our sea stores, and obliged
to procure more. At length the fleet sailed, the general and all
his army on board, bound to Louisburg,<a name="FNanchor_194_195" id="FNanchor_194_195"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_194_195" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> with intent to besiege
and take that fortress; all the packet boats in company ordered
to attend the general's ship, ready to receive his dispatches when
they should be ready. We were out five days before we got a
letter with leave to part, and then our ship quitted the fleet and
steered for England. The other two packets he still detained,
carried them with him to Halifax, where he stayed some time to
exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts, then altered
his mind as to besieging Louisburg, and returned to New York
with all his troops, together with the two packets above mentioned,
and all their passengers! During his absence the French
and savages had taken Fort George, on the frontier of that province,
and the savages had massacred many of the garrison after
capitulation.</p>

<p>I saw afterward in London Captain Bonnell, who commanded
one of those packets. He told me that, when he had been detained
a month, he acquainted his lordship that his ship was
grown foul to a degree that must necessarily hinder her fast
sailing, a point of consequence for a packet boat, and requested
an allowance of time to heave her down and clean her bottom.
He was asked how long time that would require. He answered,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
"Three days." The general replied: "If you can do it in one
day, I give leave; otherwise not; for you must certainly sail the
day after to-morrow." So he never obtained leave, though detained
afterward from day to day during full three months.</p>

<p>I saw also in London one of Bonnell's passengers, who was so
enraged against his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so
long at New York, and then carrying him to Halifax and back
again, that he swore he would sue him for damages. Whether
he did or not, I never heard; but, as he represented the injury to
his affairs, it was very considerable.</p>

<p>On the whole, I wondered much how such a man came to be
intrusted with so important a business as the conduct of a great
army; but, having since seen more of the great world, and the
means of obtaining and motives for giving places, my wonder is
diminished. General Shirley, on whom the command of the army
devolved upon the death of Braddock, would, in my opinion, if
continued in place, have made a much better campaign than that
of Loudoun in 1757, which was frivolous, expensive, and disgraceful
to our nation beyond conception; for, though Shirley
was not a bred soldier, he was sensible and sagacious in himself,
and attentive to good advice from others, capable of forming
judicious plans, and quick and active in carrying them into execution.
Loudoun, instead of defending the colonies with his
great army, left them totally exposed, while he paraded idly at
Halifax, by which means Fort George was lost. Besides, he deranged
all our mercantile operations, and distressed our trade, by
a long embargo<a name="FNanchor_195_196" id="FNanchor_195_196"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_195_196" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> on the exportation of provisions, on pretense of
keeping supplies from being obtained by the enemy, but in reality
for beating down their price in favor of the contractors, in whose
profits, it was said, perhaps from suspicion only, he had a share.
And when at length the embargo was taken off by neglecting to
send notice of it to Charleston, the Carolina fleet was detained
near three months longer, whereby their bottoms were so much
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
damaged by the worm<a name="FNanchor_196_197" id="FNanchor_196_197"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_196_197" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> that a great part of them foundered in
their passage home.</p>

<p>Shirley was, I believe, sincerely glad of being relieved from so
burdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a
man unacquainted with military business. I was at the entertainment
given by the city of New York to Lord Loudoun, on his
taking upon him the command. Shirley, though thereby superseded,
was present also. There was a great company of officers,
citizens, and strangers, and, some chairs having been borrowed
in the neighborhood, there was one among them very low, which
fell to the lot of Mr. Shirley. Perceiving it as I sat by him, I
said, "They have given you, sir, too low a seat." "No matter,"
says he, "Mr. Franklin, I find a <i>low seat</i> the easiest."</p>

<p>While I was, as afore mentioned, detained at New York, I
received all the accounts of the provisions, etc., that I had furnished
to Braddock, some of which accounts could not sooner
be obtained from the different persons I had employed to assist
in the business. I presented them to Lord Loudoun, desiring to
be paid the balance. He caused them to be regularly examined
by the proper officer, who, after comparing every article with its
voucher, certified them to be right, and the balance due, for
which his lordship promised to give me an order on the paymaster.
This was, however, put off from time to time; and, though
I called often for it by appointment, I did not get it. At length,
just before my departure, he told me he had, on better consideration,
concluded not to mix his accounts with those of his predecessors.
"And you," says he, "when in England, have only to
exhibit your accounts at the treasury, and you will be paid immediately."</p>

<p>I mentioned, but without effect, the great and unexpected expense
I had been put to by being detained so long at New York,
as a reason for my desiring to be presently paid; and on my observing
that it was not right I should be put to any further trouble
or delay in obtaining the money I had advanced, as I charged
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
no commission for my service, "O sir," says he, "you must not
think of persuading us that you are no gainer; we understand
better those affairs, and know that every one concerned in supplying
the army finds means, in the doing it, to fill his own pockets."
I assured him that was not my case, and that I had not pocketed
a farthing, but he appeared clearly not to believe me; and, indeed,
I have since learned that immense fortunes are often made
in such employments. As to my balance, I am not paid it to
this day, of which more hereafter.</p>

<p>Our captain of the packet had boasted much, before we sailed,
of the swiftness of his ship; unfortunately, when we came to sea,
she proved the dullest of ninety-six sail, to his no small mortification.
After many conjectures respecting the cause, when we
were near another ship almost as dull as ours, which, however,
gained upon us, the captain ordered all hands to come aft, and
stand as near the ensign staff<a name="FNanchor_197_198" id="FNanchor_197_198"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_197_198" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> as possible. We were, passengers
included, about forty persons. While we stood there, the ship
mended her pace, and soon left her neighbor far behind, which
proved clearly what our captain suspected, that she was loaded
too much by the head. The casks of water, it seems, had been
all placed forward; these he therefore ordered to be moved farther
aft, on which the ship recovered her character, and proved
the best sailer in the fleet.</p>

<p>The captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen
knots, which is accounted thirteen miles per hour. We had on
board, as a passenger, Captain Kennedy, of the navy, who contended
that it was impossible, that no ship ever sailed so fast,
and that there must have been some error in the division of the
log line,<a name="FNanchor_198_199" id="FNanchor_198_199"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_198_199" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> or some mistake
    in heaving the log. A wager ensued
between the two captains, to be decided when there should be
sufficient wind. Kennedy thereupon examined rigorously the
log line, and, being satisfied with that, he determined to throw
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the log himself. Accordingly, some days after, when the wind
blew very fair and fresh, and the captain of the packet, Lutwidge,
said he believed she then went at the rate of thirteen knots, Kennedy
made the experiment, and owned his wager lost.</p>

<p>The above fact I give for the sake of the following observation.
It has been remarked, as an imperfection in the art of ship
building, that it can never be known, till she is tried, whether a
new ship will or will not be a good sailer; for that the model of
a good sailing ship has been exactly followed in a new one, which
has proved, on the contrary, remarkably dull. I apprehend that
this may partly be occasioned by the different opinions of seamen
respecting the modes of lading, rigging, and sailing of a ship.
Each has his system; and the same vessel, laden by the judgment
and orders of one captain, shall sail better or worse than when
by the orders of another. Besides, it scarce ever happens that a
ship is formed, fitted for the sea, and sailed by the same person.
One man builds the hull, another rigs her, a third lades and sails
her. No one of these has the advantage of knowing all the ideas
and experience of the others, and therefore cannot draw just conclusions
from a combination of the whole.</p>

<p>Even in the simple operation of sailing when at sea, I have
often observed different judgments in the officers who commanded
the successive watches,<a name="FNanchor_199_200" id="FNanchor_199_200"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_199_200" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> the wind being the same. One
would have the sails trimmed sharper or flatter than another, so
that they seemed to have no certain rule to govern by. Yet I
think a set of experiments might be instituted,<a name="FNanchor_N_23" id="FNanchor_N_23"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_23" class="fnanchor">[n]</a> first, to determine
the most proper form of the hull for swift sailing; next, the best
dimensions and properest place for the masts; then the form and
quantity of sails, and their position, as the wind may be; and,
lastly, the disposition of the lading. This is an age of experiments,
and I think a set accurately made and combined would
be of great use. I am persuaded, therefore, that ere long some
ingenious philosopher will undertake it, to whom I wish success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
    We were several times chased<a name="FNanchor_200_201" id="FNanchor_200_201"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_200_201" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> in our passage, but outsailed
everything, and in thirty days had soundings.
    <a name="FNanchor_201_202" id="FNanchor_201_202"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_201_202" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> We had a good
observation,<a name="FNanchor_202_203" id="FNanchor_202_203"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_202_203" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and the captain judged himself so near our port,
Falmouth, that, if we made a good run in the night, we might be
off the mouth of that harbor in the morning, and by running in
the night might escape the notice of the enemy's privateers,
    <a name="FNanchor_203_204" id="FNanchor_203_204"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_203_204" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> who
often cruised near the entrance of the channel. Accordingly, all
the sail was set that we could possibly make, and the wind being
very fresh and fair, we went right before it, and made great way.
The captain, after his observation, shaped his course, as he
thought, so as to pass wide of the Scilly Isles; but it seems there
is sometimes a strong indraught<a name="FNanchor_204_205" id="FNanchor_204_205"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_204_205" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> setting up St. George's Channel,
which deceives seamen and caused the loss of Sir Cloudesley
Shovel's squadron. This indraught was probably the cause of
what happened to us.</p>

<p>We had a watchman placed in the bow, to whom they often
called, "Look well out before there," and he as often answered,
"Ay, ay;" but perhaps he had his eyes shut, and was half asleep at
the time, they sometimes answering, as is said, mechanically; for
he did not see a light just before us, which had been hid by the
studding sails<a name="FNanchor_205_206" id="FNanchor_205_206"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_205_206" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> from the man at the helm, and from the rest of
the watch, but by an accidental yaw of the ship was discovered
and occasioned a great alarm, we being very near it, the light appearing
to me as big as a cart wheel. It was midnight, and our
captain fast asleep; but Captain Kennedy, jumping upon deck,
and seeing the danger, ordered the ship to wear round, all sails
standing&mdash;an operation dangerous to the masts; but it carried us
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
clear, and we escaped shipwreck, for we were running right upon
the rocks on which the lighthouse was erected. This deliverance
impressed me strongly with the utility of lighthouses, and made
me resolve to encourage the building of more of them in America,
if I should live to return there.</p>

<p>In the morning it was found by the soundings, etc., that we
were near our port, but a thick fog hid the land from our sight.
About nine o'clock the fog began to rise, and seemed to be lifted
up from the water like the curtain at a playhouse, discovering
underneath the town of Falmouth, the vessels in its harbor, and
the fields that surrounded it. This was a most pleasing spectacle
to those who had been so long without any other prospects than
the uniform view of a vacant ocean, and it gave us the more
pleasure as we were now free from the anxieties which the state
of war occasioned.</p>

<p>I set out immediately, with my son, for London, and we only
stopped a little by the way to view Stonehenge on Salisbury
Plain, and Lord Pembroke's house and gardens, with his very
curious antiquities at Wilton. We arrived in London the 27th of
July, 1757.<a name="FNanchor_206_207" id="FNanchor_206_207"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_206_207" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>As soon as I was settled in a lodging Mr. Charles had provided
for me, I went to visit Dr. Fothergill, to whom I was strongly
recommended, and whose counsel respecting my proceedings I
was advised to obtain. He was against an immediate complaint
to government, and thought the proprietaries should first be
personally applied to, who might possibly be induced by the
interposition and persuasion of some private friends, to accommodate
matters amicably. I then waited on my old friend and
correspondent, Mr. Peter Collinson, who told me that John Hanbury,
the great Virginia merchant, had requested to be informed
when I should arrive, that he might carry me to Lord Granville's,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
who was then President of the Council, and wished to see me as
soon as possible. I agreed to go with him the next morning.
Accordingly, Mr. Hanbury called for me and took me in his carriage
to that nobleman's, who received me with great civility;
and after some questions respecting the present state of affairs in
America and discourse thereupon, he said to me: "You Americans
have wrong ideas of the nature of your Constitution; you
contend that the king's instructions to his governors are not laws,
and think yourselves at liberty to regard or disregard them at
your own discretion. But those instructions are not like the
pocket instructions given to a minister going abroad, for regulating
his conduct in some trifling point of ceremony. They are
first drawn up by judges learned in the laws; they are then considered,
debated, and perhaps amended in Council, after which
they are signed by the king. They are then, so far as they relate
to you, the law of the land, for the king is the legislator of
the colonies."</p>

<p>I told his lordship this was new doctrine to me. I had
always understood from our charters that our laws were to be
made by our Assemblies, to be presented indeed to the king
for his royal assent, but that being once given, the king could
not repeal or alter them; and as the Assemblies could not
make permanent laws without his assent, so neither could he
make a law for them without theirs. He assured me I was totally
mistaken. I did not think so, however, and his lordship's
conversation having a little alarmed me as to what might be the
sentiments of the court concerning us, I wrote it down as soon
as I returned to my lodgings. I recollected that about twenty
years before, a clause in a bill brought into Parliament by the
ministry had proposed to make the king's instructions laws in
the colonies, but the clause was thrown out by the Commons,
for which we adored them as our friends and friends of liberty,
till by their conduct toward us in 1765 it seemed that they had
refused that point of sovereignty to the king only that they might
reserve it for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
    After some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries,
they agreed to a meeting with me at Mr. T. Penn's house
in Spring Garden. The conversation at first consisted of mutual
declarations of disposition to reasonable accommodations, but I
suppose each party had its own ideas of what should be meant
by "reasonable." We then went into consideration of our several
points of complaint, which I enumerated. The proprietaries justified
their conduct as well as they could, and I the Assembly's.
We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our
opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement. However, it
was concluded that I should give them the heads of our complaints
in writing, and they promised then to consider them. I
did so soon after, but they put the paper into the hands of their
solicitor, Ferdinand John Paris, who managed for them all their
law business in their great suit with the neighboring proprietary
of Maryland, Lord Baltimore, which had subsisted seventy years,
and who wrote for them all their papers and messages in their
dispute with the Assembly. He was a proud, angry man, and
as I had occasionally in the answers of the Assembly treated his
papers with some severity, they being really weak in point of
argument and haughty in expression, he had conceived a mortal
enmity to me, which discovering itself whenever we met, I declined
the proprietaries' proposal that he and I should discuss the
heads of complaint between our two selves, and refused treating
with any one but them. They then by his advice put the paper
into the hands of the attorney and solicitor-general, for their
opinion and counsel upon it, where it lay unanswered a year
wanting eight days, during which time I made frequent demands
of an answer from the proprietaries, but without obtaining any
other than that they had not yet received the opinion of the attorney
and solicitor-general. What it was when they did receive
it I never learned, for they did not communicate it to me, but
sent a long message to the Assembly, drawn and signed by Paris,
reciting my paper, complaining of its want of formality as a rudeness
on my part, and giving a flimsy justification of their conduct,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
adding that they should be willing to accommodate matters if
the Assembly would send out "some person of candor" to treat
with them for that purpose, intimating thereby that I was not such.</p>

<p>The want of formality, or rudeness, was, probably, my not having
addressed the paper to them with their assumed titles of
"True and Absolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania,"
which I omitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper
the intention of which was only to reduce to a certainty by writing
what in conversation I had delivered <i>viva voce</i>.
    <a name="FNanchor_207_208" id="FNanchor_207_208"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_207_208" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>But during this delay, the Assembly having prevailed with
Governor Denny to pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in
common with the estates of the people, which was the grand
point in dispute, they omitted answering the message.</p>

<p>When this act, however, came over, the proprietaries, counseled
by Paris, determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent.
Accordingly they petitioned the king in Council, and a
hearing was appointed in which two lawyers were employed by
them against the act, and two by me in support of it. They
alleged that the act was intended to load the proprietary estate
in order to spare those of the people, and that if it were suffered
to continue in force, and the proprietaries, who were in odium
with the people, left to their mercy in proportioning the taxes,
they would inevitably be ruined. We replied that the act had
no such intention, and would have no such effect; that the assessors
were honest and discreet men under an oath to assess fairly
and equitably, and that any advantage each of them might expect
in lessening his own tax by augmenting that of the proprietaries
was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves.</p>

<p>This is the purport of what I remember as urged by both sides,
except that we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequences
that must attend a repeal, for that the money, one hundred thousand
pounds, being printed and given to the king's use, expended
in his service, and now spread among the people, the repeal would
strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of many, and the total
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
discouragement of future grants; and the selfishness of the proprietors
in soliciting such a general catastrophe, merely from a
groundless fear of their estate being taxed too highly, was insisted
on in the strongest terms.</p>

<p>On this, Lord Mansfield, one of the counsel, rose, and beckoning
me, took me into the clerk's chamber, while the lawyers
were pleading, and asked me if I was really of opinion that
no injury would be done the proprietary estate in the execution
of the act. I said, "Certainly." "Then," says he, "you can
have little objection to enter into an engagement to assure that
point." I answered, "None at all." He then called in Paris,
and after some discourse, his lordship's proposition was accepted
on both sides; a paper to the purpose was drawn up by the clerk
of the Council, which I signed with Mr. Charles, who was also an
agent of the province for their ordinary affairs, when Lord Mansfield
returned to the council chamber, where finally the law was
allowed to pass. Some changes were, however, recommended,
and we also engaged they should be made by a subsequent law,
but the Assembly did not think them necessary; for one year's
tax having been levied by the act before the order of Council
arrived, they appointed a committee to examine the proceedings
of the assessors, and on this committee they put several particular
friends of the proprietaries. After a full inquiry, they unanimously
signed a report that they found the tax had been assessed
with perfect equity.</p>

<p>The Assembly looked upon my entering into the first part of the
engagement as an essential service to the province, since it secured
the credit of the paper money then spread over all the
country. They gave me their thanks in form when I returned.
But the proprietaries were enraged at Governor Denny for having
passed the act, and turned him out with threats of suing him
for breach of instructions which he had given bond to observe.
He, however, having done it at the instance of the general, and
for his Majesty's service, and having some powerful interest at
court, despised the threats, and they were never put in execution.</p>

<span class="smcap">From Mr. Abel James (Received in Paris).</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear and Honored Friend</span>: I have often been desirous
of writing to thee, but could not be reconciled to the thought that
the letter might fall into the hands of the British, lest some printer or
busybody should publish some part of the contents, and give our
friend pain, and myself censure.</p>

<p>"Some time since there fell into my hands, to my great joy, about
twenty-three sheets in thy own handwriting, containing an account of
the parentage and life of thyself, directed to thy son, ending in the
year 1730; with which there were notes, likewise in thy writing; a
copy of which I inclose, in hopes it may be a means, if thou continued
it up to a later period, that the first and latter part may be put together;
and if it is not yet continued, I hope thee will not delay it.
Life is uncertain, as the preacher tells us; and what will the world say
if kind, humane, and benevolent Ben. Franklin should leave his friends
and the world deprived of so pleasing and profitable a work; a work
which would be useful and entertaining not only to a few, but to millions?
The influence writings under that class have on the minds of
youth is very great, and has nowhere appeared to me so plain as
in our public friend's journals. It almost insensibly leads the youth
into the resolution of endeavoring to become as good and eminent as
the journalist. Should thine, for instance, when published (and I
think it could not fail of it), lead the youth to equal the industry and
temperance of thy early youth, what a blessing with that class would
such a work be! I know of no character living, nor many of them
put together, who has so much in his power as thyself to promote a
greater spirit of industry and early attention to business, frugality, and
temperance with the American youth. Not that I think the work
would have no other merit and use in the world&mdash;far from it; but the
first is of such vast importance that I know nothing that can equal it."</p>

<h2><a name="THE" id="THE"></a>THE WAY TO WEALTH,</h2>

<h3>AS CLEARLY SHOWN IN THE PREFACE OF AN OLD PENNSYLVANIA<br />
ALMANAC ENTITLED "POOR RICHARD IMPROVED."</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Courteous Reader</span>: I have heard that nothing gives an author so
great pleasure as to find his works respectfully quoted by other learned
authors. This pleasure I have seldom enjoyed; for, though I have been,
if I may say it without vanity, an eminent author (of almanacs) annually,
now a full quarter of a century, my brother authors in the same way, for
what reason I know not, have ever been very sparing in their applauses
and no other author has taken the least notice of me; so that, did not
my writings produce me some solid pudding, the great deficiency of
praise would have quite discouraged me.</p>

<p>I concluded at length that the people were the best judges of
my merit, for they buy my works; and, besides, in my rambles where
I am not personally known, I have frequently heard one or other
of my adages repeated with "As Poor Richard says" at the end of
it. This gave me some satisfaction, as it showed not only that my
instructions were regarded, but discovered likewise some respect for
my authority; and I own that, to encourage the practice of remembering
and reading those wise sentences, I have sometimes quoted myself
with great gravity.</p>

<p>Judge, then, how much I must have been gratified by an incident I
am going to relate to you. I stopped my horse lately where a great
number of people were collected at an auction of merchants' goods.
The hour of the sale not being come, they were conversing on the
badness of the times; and one of the company called to a plain, clean
old man with white locks, "Pray, Father Abraham, what think you
of the times? Will not these heavy taxes quite ruin the country?
How shall we ever be able to pay them? What would you advise us
to do?" Father Abraham stood up and replied, "If you would have
my advice, I will give it to you in short; for A word to the wise is
enough, as Poor Richard says." They joined in desiring him to speak
his mind, and gathering round him, he proceeded as follows:</p>

<p>"Friends," said he, "the taxes are indeed very heavy, and if those
laid on by the government were the only ones we had to pay, we
might more easily discharge them; but we have many others, and
much more grievous to some of us. We are taxed twice as much by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
our idleness, three times as much by our pride, and four times as much
by our folly; and from these taxes the commissioners cannot ease
or deliver us by allowing an abatement. However, let us hearken to
good advice, and something may be done for us; God helps them
that help themselves, as Poor Richard says.</p>

<p>I. "It would be thought a hard government that should tax its
people one tenth part of their time, to be employed in its service; but
idleness taxes many of us much more; sloth, by bringing on diseases,
absolutely shortens life. Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than labor
wears, while The used key is always bright, as Poor Richard says.
But dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that is the stuff
life is made of, as Poor Richard says. How much more than is necessary
do we spend in sleep, forgetting that the sleeping fox catches no
poultry, and that there will be sleeping enough in the grave, as Poor
Richard says. If time be of all things the most precious, wasting
time must be, as Poor Richard says, the greatest prodigality; since,
as he elsewhere tells us, Lost time is never found again, and what we
call time enough always proves little enough. Let us, then, be up and
be doing, and doing to the purpose; so by diligence shall we do more
with less perplexity. Sloth makes all things difficult, but industry, all
easy; and, He that riseth late must trot all day and shall scarce overtake
his business at night; while Laziness travels so slowly that Poverty
soon overtakes him. Drive thy business, let not that drive thee; and,
Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and
wise, as Poor Richard says.</p>

<p>"So what signifies wishing and hoping for better times? We
make these times better if we bestir ourselves. Industry need not
wish, and he that lives upon hopes will die fasting. There are no gains
without pains; then help, hands, for I have no lands; or, if I have,
they are smartly taxed. He that hath a trade hath an estate; and he
that hath a calling, hath an office of profit and honor, as Poor Richard
says; but then the trade must be worked at and the calling followed,
or neither the estate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes. If
we are industrious, we shall never starve; for, At the workingman's
house hunger looks in, but dares not enter. Nor will the bailiff or
the constable enter; for Industry pays debts, while Despair increaseth
them. What though you have found no treasure, nor has any rich
relation left you a legacy; Diligence is the mother of good luck, and
God gives all things to Industry. Then plow deep while sluggards
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
sleep, and you shall have corn to sell and to keep. Work while it is
called to-day, for you know not how much you may be hindered to-morrow.
One to-day is worth two to-morrows, as Poor Richard says;
and, further, Never leave that till to-morrow which you can do to-day.
If you were a good servant, would you not be ashamed that a good
master should catch you idle? Are you, then, your own master? Be
ashamed to catch yourself idle, when there is so much to be done for
yourself, your family, your country, your kin. Handle your tools without
mittens; remember that The cat in gloves catches no mice, as Poor
Richard says. It is true there is much to be done, and perhaps you
are weak-handed; but stick to it steadily, and you will see great effects;
for, Constant dropping wears away stones; and, By diligence and
patience the mouse ate in two the cable; and, Little strokes fell great
oaks.</p>

<p>"Methinks I hear some of you say, Must a man afford himself no
leisure? I will tell thee, my friend, what Poor Richard says: Employ
thy time well, if thou meanest to gain leisure; and since thou art
not sure of a minute, throw not away an hour. Leisure is time for
doing something useful; this leisure the diligent man will obtain, but
the lazy man never; for, A life of leisure and a life of laziness are two
things. Many, without labor, would live by their wits only, but they
break for want of stock; whereas industry gives comfort and plenty
and respect. Fly pleasures and they will follow you. The diligent
spinner has a large shift; and now I have a sheep and a cow, every
one bids me good morrow.</p>

<p>II. "But with our industry we must likewise be steady and careful,
and oversee our own affairs with our own eyes, and not trust too much
to others; for, as Poor Richard says:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I never saw an oft-removed tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet an oft-removed family,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That throve so well as those that settled be.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And again, Three removes are as bad as a fire; and again, Keep thy
shop, and thy shop will keep thee; and again, If you would have your
business done, go; if not, send; and again:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He that by the plow would thrive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself must either hold or drive.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
    And again, The eye of the master will do more work than both his
hands; and again, Want of care does us more damage than want of
knowledge; and again, Not to oversee workmen is to leave them your
purse open. Trusting too much to others' care is the ruin of many;
for, In the affairs of this world men are saved, not by faith, but by the
want of it. But a man's own care is profitable; for, If you would have a
faithful servant and one that you like, serve yourself. A little neglect
may breed great mischief; for want of a nail the shoe was lost, for
want of a shoe the horse was lost, and for want of a horse the rider
was lost, being overtaken and slain by the enemy; all for want of a
little care about a horseshoe nail.</p>

<p>III. "So much for industry, my friends, and attention to one's own
business; but to these we must add frugality, if we would make our industry
more certainly successful. A man may, if he knows not how
to save as he gets, keep his nose all his life to the grindstone, and die
not worth a groat at last. A fat kitchen makes a lean will; and</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Many estates are spent in the getting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since women forsook spinning and knitting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men for punch forsook hewing and splitting.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If you would be wealthy, think of saving as well as of getting. The
Indies have not made Spain rich, because her outgoes are greater than
her incomes.</p>

<p>"Away, then, with your expensive follies, and you will not then
have so much cause to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and chargeable
families; for</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pleasure and wine, game and deceit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make the wealth small, and the want great.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And further, What maintains one vice would bring up two children.
You may think, perhaps, that a little tea or a little punch now and
then, diet a little more costly, clothes a little finer, and a little entertainment
now and then, can be no great matter; but remember, Many
a little makes a mickle. Beware of little expenses; A small leak will
sink a great ship, as Poor Richard says; and again, Who dainties love
shall beggars prove; and moreover, Fools make feasts and wise men
eat them.</p>

<p>"Here you are all got together at this sale of fineries and knick-knacks.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
You call them goods; but, if you do not take care, they
will prove evils to some of you. You expect they will be sold cheap,
and perhaps they may for less than they cost; but, if you have no occasion
for them, they must be dear to you. Remember what Poor
Richard says: Buy what thou hast no need of, and ere long thou shalt
sell thy necessaries. And again, At a great pennyworth pause awhile.
He means that perhaps the cheapness is apparent only, and not
real; or, the bargain, by straitening thee in thy business, may do
thee more harm than good. For in another place he says, Many
have been ruined by buying good pennyworths. Again, It is foolish
to lay out money in a purchase of repentance; and yet this folly is
practiced every day at auctions for want of minding the Almanac.
    <a name="FNanchor_208_209" id="FNanchor_208_209"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_208_209" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
Many for the sake of finery on the back have gone hungry and half-starved
their families. Silks and satins, scarlet and velvets, put out
the kitchen fire, as Poor Richard says.</p>

<p>"These are not the necessaries of life; they can scarcely be called
the conveniences; and yet, only because they look pretty, how many
want to have them. By these and other extravagances the genteel
are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of those whom they formerly
despised, but who, through industry and frugality, have maintained
their standing; in which case it appears plainly that, A plowman
on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees, as Poor
Richard says. Perhaps they have a small estate left them which they
knew not the getting of; they think, It is day and it never will
be night; that a little to be spent out of so much is not worth minding;
but, Always taking out of the meal tub and never putting in, soon
comes to the bottom, as Poor Richard says; and then, When the
well is dry, they know the worth of water. But this they might have
known before, if they had taken his advice. If you would know the
value of money, go and try to borrow some; for, He that goes a-borrowing
goes a-sorrowing, as Poor Richard says; and, indeed, so does
he that lends to such people, when he goes to get it in again. Poor
Dick further advises and says:</p>

<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fond pride of dress is sure a very curse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere fancy you consult, consult your purse.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And again, Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, and a great deal more
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
saucy. <a name="When" id="When"></a>When you have bought one fine thing, you must buy ten
more, that your appearance may be all of a piece; but Poor Dick says,
It is easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that follow it.
And it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as for the frog to
swell in order to equal the ox.</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Vessels large may venture more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But little boats should keep near shore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is, however, a folly soon punished; for, as Poor Richard says, Pride
that dines on vanity, sups on contempt. Pride breakfasted with
Plenty, dined with Poverty, and supped with Infamy. And, after all,
of what use is this pride of appearance, for which so much is risked,
so much is suffered? It cannot promote health nor ease pain; it
makes no increase of merit in the person; it creates envy; it hastens
misfortune.</p>

<p>"But what madness must it be to run in debt for these superfluities?
We are offered by the terms of this sale six months' credit; and
that, perhaps, has induced some of us to attend it, because we cannot
spare the ready money, and hope now to be fine without it. But
ah! think what you do when you run in debt; you give to another
power over your liberty. If you cannot pay at the time, you will be
ashamed to see your creditor; you will be in fear when you speak to
him; you will make poor, pitiful, sneaking excuses, and by degrees
come to lose your veracity, and sink into base, downright lying; for,
The second vice is lying, the first is running in debt, as Poor
Richard says; and again to the same purpose, Lying rides upon debt's
back; whereas a freeborn Englishman ought not to be ashamed nor
afraid to see or speak to any man living. But poverty often deprives
a man of all spirit and virtue. It is hard for an empty bag to stand
upright.</p>

<p>"What would you think of that prince, or of that government, who
should issue an edict forbidding you to dress like a gentleman or gentlewoman,
on pain of imprisonment or servitude? Would you not
say that you are free, have a right to dress as you please, and that
such an edict would be a breach of your privileges and such a government
tyrannical? And yet you are about to put yourself under such
tyranny, when you run in debt for such dress. Your creditor has
authority, at his pleasure, to deprive you of your liberty by confining
you in jail till you shall be able to pay him. When you have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
got your bargain, you may, perhaps, think little of payment; but, as
Poor Richard says, Creditors have better memories than debtors;
creditors are a superstitious sect, great observers of set days and times.
The day comes round before you are aware, and the demand is made
before you are prepared to satisfy it; or, if you bear your debt in
mind, the term, which at first seemed so long, will, as it lessens, appear
extremely short. Time will seem to have added wings to his
heels as well as his shoulders. Those have a short Lent who owe
money to be paid at Easter. At present, perhaps, you may think
yourselves in thriving circumstances, and that you can bear a little
extravagance without injury; but</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For age and want save while you may;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No morning sun lasts a whole day.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but ever, while you live, expense
is constant and certain; and, It is easier to build two chimneys
than to keep one in fuel, as Poor Richard says; so, Rather go to bed
supperless than rise in debt.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Get what you can, and what you get, hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis the stone that will turn all your lead into gold.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And when you have got the philosopher's stone, be sure you will no
longer complain of bad times or the difficulty of paying taxes.</p>

<p>IV. "This doctrine, my friends, is reason and wisdom; but, after
all, do not depend too much upon your own industry and frugality
and prudence, though excellent things; for they may all be blasted,
without the blessing of Heaven; and, therefore, ask that blessing humbly,
and be not uncharitable to those that at present seem to want it,
but comfort and help them. Remember Job suffered, and was afterward
prosperous.</p>

<p>"And now, to conclude, Experience keeps a dear school, but fools
will learn in no other, as Poor Richard says, and scarce in that; for,
it is true, we may give advice, but we cannot give conduct. However,
remember this: They that will not be counseled cannot be
helped; and further that, If you will not hear Reason, she will surely
rap your knuckles, as Poor Richard says."</p>

<p>Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The people heard it,
and approved the doctrine, and immediately practiced the contrary,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
just as if it had been a common sermon; for the auction opened and
they began to buy extravagantly. I found the good man had thoroughly
studied my almanacs, and digested all I had dropped on these
topics during the course of twenty-five years. The frequent mention
he made of me must have tired any one else; but my vanity was wonderfully
delighted with it, though I was conscious that not a tenth
part of the wisdom was my own which he ascribed to me, but rather
the gleanings that I had made of the sense of all ages and nations.
However, I resolved to be the better for the echo of it; and, though I
had at first determined to buy stuff for a new coat, I went away resolved
to wear my old one a little longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the
same, thy profit will be as great as mine. I am, as ever, thine to
serve thee,</p>

<h2>NOTES AND SUGGESTIONS</h2>

<p>Though he did not consider himself a man of letters, Franklin
was throughout his long life a writer. His writing was incidental to
his business as a journalist and statesman. He also corresponded
widely with various classes of people. Fortunately many of these
writings have been preserved, and from these and the <i>Autobiography</i>
a number of valuable lives have been written. The student will find
pleasure in referring to the Franklin volumes of the American Statesmen
Series and of the American Men of Letters Series. The three
volume life by Mr. John Bigelow and the one volume, <i>The Many-sided
Franklin</i>, by Paul Leicester Ford, will supply the years of
Franklin's life not included in his autobiography, the writing of
which was several times interrupted by public business of the greatest
importance, and finally cut short by the long illness that preceded
his death.</p>

<p>Read the pages devoted to Franklin in Brander Matthews' <i>Introduction
to American Literature</i>. Matthews says of him, "He was the
first great American&mdash;for Washington was twenty-six years younger."
"He was the only man who signed the Declaration of Independence,
the Treaty of Alliance with France, the Treaty of Peace with England,
and the Constitution under which we still live."</p>

<p>As you read Franklin's pages be on the alert for material to support
Mr. Matthews' statement, "Franklin was the first of American
humorists, and to this day he has not been surpassed in his own
line." Will one of you report to the class on "Franklin's Humor"?</p>

<p>Franklin was far in advance of his times on many questions. In
1783, when concluding the Treaty of Peace with England, he tried
to secure the adoption of a clause protecting the property of non-belligerents
in subsequent wars. England would not accept this
advanced idea, but Frederick II of Prussia agreed to it, and since
that time all civilized governments have united in embodying it in
the Law of Nations.</p>

<p>Franklin was one of the first and, in proportion to his means, one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
<a name="of" id="of"></a>of the greatest of American philanthropists. He said that he had
"a trick for doing a deal of good with a little money." In lending
some money to one who had applied to him for assistance, he instructed
the borrower to pass it on to some one else in distress as
soon as he could afford to repay it. "I hope it may thus go through
many hands, before it meets with a knave that will stop its progress."</p>

<p>Mr. Bigelow's Life of Franklin reproduces the philosopher's exact
spelling. He was one of the early spelling reformers. See his "Petition
of the Letter Z," p. 116, <i>The Many-sided Franklin</i>.</p>

<p>You will be interested in following Franklin's experiments in
determining the value of oil in stilling the waves, and also his investigations
of the Gulf Stream and of the nature of storms. He
asked, "What signifies philosophy that does not apply to some
use?" Yet he had a wonderful imagination back of his practical
nature.</p>

<p>Emerson says that the chief use of a book is to inspire. On this
basis how do you rank the <i>Autobiography</i> in usefulness?</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
